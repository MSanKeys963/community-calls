# 2023-10-04

**Attending:** Josh Moore (JM), Sanket Verma (SV), Davis Bennett (DB), John Kirkham (JK), Norman Rzepka (NR)

## TL;DR:

We started the meeting by discussing the steps required for a new numcodecs release. NR is thinking of writing a new blog post which involves Zarrita and Webknossos. SV shared an announcement involving Zarr, and DB wondered if Webknossos supports the Jupyter widget

**Updates:**

- Two new repositories related to Zarr-Python benchmark:
    - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-benchmark>
    - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/perfcapture>

**Meeting Minutes:**

- Numcodecs release
    - Needs to fix the NumPy issue before releasing
    - DB: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/pull/335> - thoughts?
    - JM: Other option to put this into Zarr-Python itself
    - DB: Will close the PR and move it over to Zarr-Python
    - DB: Not proposing a change to the specification - Minor change to check if codec is `None`
- NR: Thinking of writing a blog post on for  <https://zarr.dev/blog/>
    - Used [Zarrita](https://github.com/scalableminds/zarrita/) for [Webknossos](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/) with blosc and C standard codec and there was 30% reduction in the storage space in servers
    - Before this we were using LZ4 compression
    - DB: The backend is in Scala? NR: Yes!
    - NR: Will share a HackMD/similar document for everyone to review
- JM: Summary of the latest Zarr-Python benchmark and performance meeting
    - Meeting notes: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5VBWqyh_MliVZCy9KK8ZnMy2pIeKF5pTLI2XWZ0MNE/edit?usp=sharing>
- SV: Earthmover announcement - Arraylake: <https://twitter.com/EarthmoverHQ/status/1709620436235948243>
    - DB: Like the idea of Jupyter integration - the group I work for would be a traget market for Arraylake
    - DB: Will look into the webinar
    - DB: Better than our existing infrastructure, i.e. on S3 - good for scalability but seems feature barren
- DB: Does Webknossos have Jupyter widget?
    - NR: Doesn't currently have it - adding something like that would be challenging as WK is not built in a way to integrate parts of it somewhere else
    - DB: Having something like that would be cool and let everyone understand the cloud importance
