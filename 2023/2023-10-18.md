**Attending:** Davis Bennett (DB), Florian Ziemen (FZ), Sanket Verma (SV), Eric Perlman (EP), Ward Fisher (WF), John Kirkham (JK), Janos Zimmermann (JZ), Norman Rzepka (NR), Dennis Heimbigner (DH)

## TL;DR:

Today, everyone shared their favourite books during the introduction round. FZ asked if NetCDF has HTTP support. WF will be submitting a pre-recorded talk to AGU and wondered if he could include anything graphical for Zarr.

SV asked for general feedback from the community and was happy to receive a positive response! üéâ

We concluded the meeting after having discussions on ZarrCon.

- Question for Ward/Dennis (Unidata) - Do you plan to have support for HTTP in NetCDF-C? Open for collaborations?
    - FZ: Idea is to use NetCDF to access Zarr Store via HTTPS
    - WF: Happy to expand on this in the meeting, but we support http/https through the DAP2/DAP4 protocols (https://www.opendap.org/). We also have `S3` support that we are planning how to better publicize. 
    - WF: We are also always open for collaborations!
    - DH: If data storage server can read Zarr and can handle the translations DAP3/4; it could work
    - DH: Byte range access for contiguous data
    - DH: Need to add support for Zarr directory subtree format as a driver to accomplish - good idea!

        - FZ: Mattermost similar to Slack
    - NR: Very grateful for the meeting notes!
- SV: ZarrCon
    - NR: Janelia might be interested - Having 2 conferences not makes sense - bring people from various domains together will foster collaboration
    - DB: +1 to the idea
    - EP and FZ: Align the ZarrCon with other big conferences, e.g. [Supercomputing](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/) conference
    - EP: Send out a poll to see which conferences are people going to attend
