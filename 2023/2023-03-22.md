# 2023-03-22

**Attending:** Hailiang Zhang (HZ), Sanket Verma (SV), Dieu My Nguyen (DMN), Dennis Heimbigner (DH), John Kirkham (JK), Norman Rzepka (NR), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS), Johana Chazaro-Haraksin (JCH), Davis Bennett (DB)

## TL;DR:

SV started the community meeting with a few updates. One of the most important updates was that we have a new page on the website for the Zarr adopters. Check here: <https://zarr.dev/adopters/>.

After this, HZ started presenting his ZEP, post which there was a Q&A session. After the Q&A session, we concluded the meeting with a few action items for HZ, which he‚Äôll take care of in the upcoming weeks.

**Updates:**

- New blog post: <https://zarr.dev/blog/ome-2022/> üéâ
- Zarr Adopters live at: <https://zarr.dev/adopters/>
- Zarr office hours
- Josh fixed the conda-forge error, check here: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1364>

**Meeting minutes:**

- Hailiang's [ZEP0005](https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0005.html) presentation - check the recording [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13xkl-i8pCSnv42KeqX6KLtIRFln5sf6k/view?usp=share_link)! üé•

- Q&As post the session are below üëáüèª:
    - JMS: Mathematical equation would be helpful
        - HZ: Working on a paper for more details - internal for now - will be publishing it soon!
    - DB: Is it similar to summed area table? - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table>
        - HZ: Not exactly - Trying to achieve something more centric to Zarr - making the accumulation flexible and dimension agnostic
    - JMS: I think your is trying to solve the same problem as a [summed-area table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table) solves.  But I think you‚Äôre trying to do it without requiring to storing something the same size as the original array - but perhaps imposing some additional restrictions on the type of queries you can do
        - HZ: This is more Zarr related - Jeremy has more comments on the PR - stride boundary aligned with the Zarr boundary
    - JMS: Don‚Äôt understand it fully - a mathematical equation would be helpful
    - SV: Is there a reference implementation?
        - HZ: I‚Äôm working on the code - will open-source it by the end of the summer
    - HZ: What is not clear, Jeremy?
        - JMS: Does the chunk needs to be aligned? 
        - HZ: For this implementation the chunks need to be aligned
    - JMS: Trying to understand the proposal in a general sense
        - HZ: We can achieve the accumulation/averaging service faster - [Giovanni](https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/) will be using this accumulation
    - DB: Would you share some cloud backed example?
        - HZ: Sure, can do!
    - SV: Having a .zarr data before and after the accumulation chunks with the attribute would be good for everyone!
        - HZ: Sure, can do and can also add the script for the data generation!
    - DB: Having a reference of summed area table would be good thing!
        - HZ: Sure, can do that!
