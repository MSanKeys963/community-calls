# 2023-06-28

**Attending:** Josh Moore (JM), Sanket Verma (SV), Davis Bennett (DB), Ward Fisher (WF), Patty Fricke (PF), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS), Norman Rzepka (NR)

## TL;DR:

We started the meeting by going around the table and asking what the last movie/TV show everyone watched was! Some excellent recommendations here.

PF asked about the [ZEP0003](https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0003.html) progress. SV has been working on a blog titled ‘Zarr vs HDF5’ and asked the community what they’d like to see in the blog. DB’s [Pydantic-Zarr](https://github.com/d-v-b/pydantic-zarr) will be publicised shortly. WF shared the development at Unidata regarding NetCDF, and Zarr is one of the focus in the upcoming months.

**Updates:**

- New blog post: <https://zarr.dev/blog/zarr-talks/> 🎉 

**Meeting Minutes:**

- Introductions with the recent movie/tv show you watched 🍿🎬🥤
    - SV: [Black Mirror](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/)
    - DB: [A Room with a View](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091867/)
    - WF: [RRR](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8178634/)
    - JM: [Heartstopper](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10638036/)
    - PF: [Extraction 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12263384/)
    - NR: [Lidia Poet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15441160/)
    - JMS: [John Wick Chapter 4 ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366206/)
- PF: ZEP0003 progress
    - SV: Not a lot
    - PF: reading in CSVs (each file a timepoint) with xarray
    - JMS: previous use cases were looking to move chunk size over time (t=1 to begin; then later t>1)
    - DB: delicate point -- anticipating a change of the metadata. performing a rechunk live could be trickier. code samples would be useful.
    - SV: Please ping in the discussion [post](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/discussions/52) to get involved
- SV: Zarr vs. HDF5 blog post
    - What would you like to have in there?
    - WF: Audience conflate NetCDF and HDF5
        - They are not same data model
        - Storage layers - cloud ready - big and cool community
        - Zarr doesn't need a server to run - lot of good momentum
        - There isn't no implementation and it would be complex to come up with one
        - NetCDF and Zarr has straightforward API
        - HDF5 parallel support with the help of DOE funding
        - Supercomputer - Uses HDF5 based MPI
    - DB: HDF5 has C implementation
        - Comparitively cheap to spin up implementations - maybe a bad thing?
        - Much more complicated to implement
        - Difficult to do massively HDF5 parallel writing
        - Zarr could have a HDF5 backend
    - JMS: Key point - parallel write support
        - Single threaded - fetching chunks from a single thread
    - WF: HPC/Supercomputing community almost exclusively using MPI
- SV: DV: [Pydantic-Zarr](https://github.com/d-v-b/pydantic-zarr) - ready to publicise it?
    - DV: Wait, until I polish the readme
    - DB: Any apetite for having this in Zarr-Python? May need to change the `creation` API
    - JM: There are some PRs which should be merged first in order to introduce the Pydantic change into Zarr-Python - we don't want you to wait on another PR
    - DB: I think the code is computationaly cheap and it'd be easy to integrate it
- JM: Looking forward for SciPy 2023 - if anyone around please come and meet us
- WF: NetCDF roadmap
  - Working on high-level roadmapping for 5+ year cycle
  - Will be adopting V3 very soon
