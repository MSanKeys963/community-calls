# 2023-01-25

**Attending:** Davis Bennett (DB), Sanket Verma (SV), Josh Moore (JM), Ethan Davis (ED) - Unidata, Ward Fisher (WF), Alan Liddell (AL), Brianna Pag√°n (BP), Erik Welch (EW), Hailey Johnson (HJ), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS), Isaac Virshup (IV)

## TL;DR:

**Release update**: [Zarr Python](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python) 2.13.6 along with 2.13.4 and 2.13.5 is out! Check the release notes [here](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release.html#release-notes). [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/present) CFP is open until 22nd February. If you‚Äôre planning to submit a proposal involving Zarr, feel free to reach out to our [community manager](mailto:svsanketverma5@gmail.com), and he‚Äôll help you out. The meeting started with DB discussing his recently opened [PR #1323](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1323). Next, JM gave us updates on [AI4Life](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/) and initiated a discussion on GeoJSON. After this, we discussed [ZEP0004](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zeps/pull/28) and [Unicode names](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/56). Next, BP gave an update on GeoZarr bi-weekly meetings, and lastly, SV asked a general question on visualising N-dimensional arrays.

**Updates:**

- Zarr-Python [2.13.4](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release.html#release-2-13-4) (outreachy updates), [2.13.5](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release.html#release-2-13-5) and [2.13.6](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release.html#release-2-13-6) is out!

**Open Agenda(add here üëáüèª):**

- [automated formatting](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1323) - Davis
  - what's the line in the sand to get it in?
  - ping the core devs, getting sharding in
- Declarative hierarchy (Davis)
  - Create object then serialize it to disk
  - JMS: maybe a layer on top of zarr (multi-formats)
  - [https://pypi.org/project/h5py-like/0.5.1/](https://pypi.org/project/h5py-like/0.5.1/)
- [AI4Life](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/), GeoJSON, etc. (Josh)
  - JM: "GeoJSON is JSON. Zarr has JSON. Can you put GeoJSON in Zarr?"
  - IV: something more like GeoArrow
  - ED: cfconventions (trajectories, etc.) for bio?
    - probably not 
    - IV: [https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#_contiguous_ragged_array_representation](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#_contiguous_ragged_array_representation)
    - IV: convention for ragged array (start in Zarr space) - least-common denominator
    - IV: shapely support for GeoArrow.
- [get_items](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1131) (Sanket) - Tabled (comments welcome)
- ZEP4 (EW)
  - looking to make an embeddable spec for sparse arrays and sparse tensors
  - natural fit for a ZEP.
  - JM: previously we had discussed an extension, right?
  - EW: convention so it can be stored along with other things.
  - IV: not super strongly about zarr being aware. but consistent way to structure things.
    - ZEP4 is more collecting what people might be doing
  - IV: break ZEP4 into a completed set of conventions and then we can identify later.
- [https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec](https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec) and [https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec/issues/2](ttps://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec/issues/2) (Brianna)
  - BP: initial meeting last week on a governance group.
      - Repo: [https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec](https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec)
      - Meeting Notes: [https://hackmd.io/@MSBYE-SmSS-O706S4WXH0Q/geozarr-spec-swg-20230119](https://hackmd.io/@MSBYE-SmSS-O706S4WXH0Q/geozarr-spec-swg-20230119)
  - meeting biweekly. invite open. Wednesday mornings 11am, Eastern.
  - submitting to OGC approval by the summer.
- Unicode for names (Ethan): [https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/56](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/56)
  - JMS: very helpful. normalization important.
    - tension of zarr not being its own container format
    - normalization by default breaks that in a subtle way
  - ED: normalize on serialization, on query, etc.
    - can see optional, but also advice on whether to do it and why.
    - world going to UTF-8
- Visualization of Zarr arrays
  - DB: neuroglancer (client-side website)
