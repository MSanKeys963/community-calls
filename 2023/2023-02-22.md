# 2023-02-22

**Attending:** Davis Bennett (DB), Sanket Verma (SV), Ward Fisher (WF), Dennis Heimbigner (DH), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS), Norman Rzepka (NR), Eric Perlman (EP), Dieu My Nguyen (DMN), Virginia Scarlett (VS)

## TL;DR:

We started the meeting by discussing some possible performance improvements for sharding. [Ryan Abernathey](https://github.com/rabernat) did some [benchmarks](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/discussions/1338) a few weeks ago, which turned out well. Then, the community offered a few solutions to make it even better. Jonathan is working on a PR for the same. After that, DB wondered, ‚ÄúHow can he only store the indexes in the cache using Zarr?‚Äù

SV asked what does everyone think about the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) bot. He also questioned whether the community would like to participate if Zarr were to organise a hack week. Both ideas were received üëçüèª from everyone.

Lastly, DB showed us what he‚Äôs working on, and JMS discussed the `zarr-specs` issue he submitted recently.

**Updates:**

- Zarr-Python 2.14.1 release with sharding and new docs theme (PyData-Sphinx)
- SciPy 2023 deadline next week (03/01), if you want to collaborate on a tutorial with us, now's the time

**Meeting Notes:**

- DB: Sharding is slow - according to [https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/1343](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/1343)
    - NR: Jonathan is working on a PR
    - DB - Using mutable mapping for interface store for `getitems` and `setitems` is the probable cause - Zarr array API has some bash logic - which may also lead to slowing down
    - DH: What type of caching model is using?
    - NR: No caching is there! - individual chunks are loaded through byte range
    - DH: having cache would be fine
    - NR: maybe! depends on the use case
    - JMS: Zarr array API does have support for batch reading and writing - if you‚Äôre giving multiple shard from single chunk the overhead would be big - you need to tell the user to cache the index - maybe twice the read requests because of the index and the shard
    - NR: Having index in cache makes sense
- DB: How to store the indexes in the cache? Maybe JSON? What would be good storage format? How about SQLite? (for my use case)
    - JMS: Unrelated to cache - you can list the chunk
    - DB: recursive and expensive 
    - JMS: S3 can give you a flat list, may not solve the problem but the abstraction would help
    - JMS: are you doing re-encoding? 
    - DB: yes
    - JMS: SQLite could be pretty reasonable solution
    - DB: Is there a clever way to do it using Zarr itself?
    - JMS: can be ordered using lexical graphs
    - DB: If your data is too big then your metadata becomes another type of data
- SV: What do you think about using [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) and hosting a Zarr hack week to sync `zarr-python` implementation to V3?
    - All: Sounds good for `all-contributors` üëçüèª
    - EP: Having something online would be good and I'd participate
    - DB: Sounds good and I'd participate
    - WF and JMS: üëçüèª
- DB: Defining abstract structure of zarr array like keys, properties, metadata - OME-Zarr has a try catch block - Have put some together with [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) - it‚Äôs simple to generate zarr group - taking abstract tree representation and running it backwards to create Zarr groups
    - Repo: [https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/pydantic-ome-ngff](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/pydantic-ome-ngff)
        - SV: Could be something like `pip install ztree` or something similar
    - DB: Trying to define protocol for HDF5 as well - could dump the hierarchy into Zarr or HDF5 container
    - DB: Structural sub typing stuff
    - SV: Would be good to show a demo? 
    - DB: Yes!
- JMS: [https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/212](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/212)
    - DB: Maybe similar to what vanilla N5 does!
    - JMS: Reasonable to add a metadata option - planning to add a extension ZEP for this
