# 2023-09-06

**Attending:** Davis Bennett (DB), Sanket Verma (SV), Ward Fisher (WF), Norman Rzepka (NR) 

## TL;DR:

Today, we touched on how to leverage Zarrita for Zarr-Python refactoring work. DB discussed how we can use Zip to store multiple Zarr files as a single .zip file. NR wondered if thereâ€™s any interest in applying for CZI EOSS6.

**Updates:**

- First Zarr-Python Refactor Kick-off meeting happened today
    - Notes: <https://hackmd.io/Rbh6oae8S7mNU-CPWWwPaw?view>

**Meeting notes:**

- DB: Discussion on leveraging Zarrita for the refactoring work
    - NR: Feel free to copy anything you'd like
- DB: Discussion at ImageSC: <https://forum.image.sc/t/saving-volumetric-data-with-voxel-size-colormap-annotations/85537/28>
    - DB: Multiple languagues standardizing Zarr in a ZipStore/some kind of archive
    - NR: Not super complicated - just have to put a Zarr archive in a Zipfile - but there should be a clear distinction between sharding and ZipStore
    - NR: Having a ZEP for this would be great - but don't know who's going to write it - up for participating in the ZEP writing process but don't want to drive it
    - WF: No red flags when looking at Zip from a legal point view - need to figure out the implementation - whether it's implemented natively or if there's a dependency
- NR: Discussion on CZI EOSS6
    - SV: Would be best to open up a GitHub issue in the community repo for collaborative discussion - something similar to: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/community/issues/22>
