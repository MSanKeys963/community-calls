-   Moving away from travis: we ran out of hours.
-   Jim: Plan to extend version 3 of zarr to deconstruct awkward arrays
    into buffers that can be individual arrays/ group of arrays for
    Zarr. Hook into a group “you need to have awkward arrays
    extensions”. Full example on one of the many zarr github issues.
    (https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/62).
-   Data Delivery Mechanism, instead of fileformat.
