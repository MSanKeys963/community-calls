    -   **Introductions**: new joinees should feel welcome to introduce
        > themselves and their interest in zarr/n5.

    -   Joseph Sheedy (Saildrone): autonomous boats for ocean data.
        > Weather forecasting team. Looking to replace backend with zarr

        > vendors

        -   Digital pathology → DICOM, Bio-Formats users. Need to keep
            metadata.
        -   Will send an invitation. Get him on the calendar invite.

-   Dennis/NetCDF update - 20:10 UK

    -   See:

    -   Committed to supporting zarr (or variant) as a backend.

    -   Running about 1.5 months behind, but have experimental working
        > implementation in netcdf-c. Pretty complete impl. of v2. Want
        > to shoehorn all of CDM.

    -   URL (http/s, s3, file) includes \#attributes to specify zarr &
        > storage format:

        -   S3: tested on non-AWS S3 at UCAR using AWS C++ SDK. Prefers
            Path format..
        -   Interoperability attempt: file directory-based. Every object
            is a dir. Zipped it should be consistent with ZipStore
        -   Netcdf4 format used internally for testing. Single-file
            storage that’s readable and writable.

    -   Modes

        -   nczarr : used C backend
        -   zarr : code reads and writes pure v2 format (simulates some
            things)
        -   s3 :

-   -   Issues:

        -   Strings
        -   User-defined types (enums, vlen, etc)
        -   Unlimited dimensions (multiples allowed)
        -   Filters

    -   Q: RyanA- https scheme? DMH: then need to pass arguments to
        > choose e.g. s3. As opposed to using s3:// which makes
        > defaults. Ryan: in python, just serve a zarr directly. DMH: to
        > be explored. What protocol? Just remote file access. Don’t
        > have it but should be straight-forward. RyanA: quite useful
        > since it allows *anyone* to become a data provider. (But not
        > *yet* spelled out in the spec) Consolidated metadata is
        > important since you don’t have to do a list on the store.

        -   DH: tried to avoid S3 prefix search. One of the ways that
            this isn’t zarr is by injecting new objects starting with
            “.nc”. Contain information needed for a faithful
            translation, but each has a list of what is contained
            (arrays, dimensions, groups). Pointers to what’s contained.
            Midway point between consolidated and directory listings.
            Important for performance. Didn’t want to read all the
            metadata all in one shot. More JIT.
        -   Stephan: how large can the consolidated metadata before it
            gets slow? Fast if in the cloud at 100MBs.
        -   Joseph: had perf. Issues with GB json files.

    -   Q: John / Is this the service you are referring
        > to? [*https://www.quantum.com/en/products/object-storage/*](https://www.quantum.com/en/products/object-storage/)?

    -   Q: John / how is char different from byte etc.? Poor man’s
        > string. Hopefully only until string is implemented.

    -   Q: John / unlimited is ragged? No. Vlen (from HDF5) is ragged.
        > Unlimited allows to expand. All uses of the unlimited
        > dimension have to have the same size. Ryan A: all dimensions
        > in Zarr are potentially appendable. John: perhaps only in
        > Python but not in the spec.

        -   [*https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.1/tutorial.html#resizing-and-appending*](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.1/tutorial.html#resizing-and-appending)
        -   DMH: colored by having started with HDF5
        -   **Josh: May need to be added to the spec**
        -   John: perhaps not allowed in all dimensions.

    -   Q: John / compression -- some work done in
        > [*https://github.com/constantinpape/zarr_implementations*](https://github.com/constantinpape/zarr_implementations)
        > to align all the implementations

        -   DMH: would like to keep the ability to use the existing HDF5
            filter system. Not necessarily ideal, but it exists and
            there are a lot of them.

        -   DMH: situation on defining filter API in v3? Still room for
            compromise. James: ongoing. Don’t have a definite v3 spec.
            Codec specs are being worked on now. Room for input.

        -   DMH: filters in HDF5 have some form of identifier and they
            are in a registry. Parameters are passed (e.g. inflate
            level) all as strings. … Concerned with how to write a C
            standard, find filters, load it, initialize it, invoke it.
            HDF5 model at least worked.

        -   DMH: will python coders invoke filters written in C. John:
            should support them, but writers may need to do specific
            work to make it happen. DMH: May need to claim some primacy
            because if it works in C then it’ll work in other languages.

            -   RyanA: something like numcodecs but “numfilters”

            -   Stephan: numcodecs -- difference between filters and
                > codecs? (in v2 it’s undefined) DMH: perhaps just their
                > purpose

            -   Stephan: have compressor API in n5. Chunks are byte
                > streams. Those are input and output. But could imagine
                > that a filter should know about target types. (Type of
                > the pointer) DMH: yeah, that’s the point of the
                > parameters.

            -   James:
                > https://numcodecs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/delta.html#module-numcodecs.delta ^
                > Specific filter in numcodecs The dtype needs to be
                > specified

            -   (Josh missed a bit here)

            -   Stephan: compressors also have various parameters, so
                > coudl filters and compressors become the same
                > interface?

    -   Q: Jonathan / sparsity -- large volume with empty areas.
        > Unnecessary to store them. Finding correct chunk size might be
        > death by a 1000 cuts.

    -   C: RyanA / thanks to NetCDF. Great to hear. Need to have that
        > discussion move to the spec repo. Lots of talking needing to
        > go on. DMH: add objects, but vanilla zarr implementation could
        > ignore the .nc files. **One way of dealing with extensions is
        > define set of prefixes for object name which can be ignored.**
        > RyanA: would like extensions to be developed in a
        > community-driven way. E.g. named dimensions but perhaps
        > without full netcdf. Make them composable. We need to look at
        > the nczarr extensions and discuss and iterate.

    -   Working Group on Information Systems and Services, space
        > agencies

-   RyanA: Meeting OGC people on Friday

    -   One negative is that it’s not certified by any body. (spec is
        > “self-certified”)

    -   Discussing there having a standards body

    -   DMH: netcdf was certified by NASA some time back.

    -   Josh: ISO/biobank investigation ongoing

    -   Boring but important.

-   Stephan?

    -   Specifying filter would be nice.

    -   James: unfamiliar with these points. Happy to discuss

    -   Stephan: combine filter & codec interface. Hard to use
        > compressors outside of zarr.

    -   Add new implementations at “VM” startup. No master file.

-   NumFOCUS newsletter

    -   “The Zarr community is currently developing version 3 of its

    -   Potentially adding governance?

-   Ralf: redoing numpy documentation (into How-tos) incl.
    reading/writing. Melissa on CZI grant is working on that.

    -   [*https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15760*](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15760)

-   Ralf: talking to NumFOCUS about overheads

    -   Talking to Stefan v. Walt on the board.

    -   See: “Financial” google drive to get an overview of the CZI pot
        > of money.

-   Joseph: gridded model data. Previously traditional NetCDF. Moving to
    zarr with S3.

    -   Having performance issues with mobile/web APIs in front of zarr.

    -   Trying to reduce latency.

    -   Will hopefully have something to present on optimization.

    -   Opened a few caching issues. John: was going to bring up.
        > LRUcache? Yes. There’s also a cache for the decompressed data.
        > Joseph: cached compressed data is fine.

    -   Balancing access times of cubed spatial measurements. General
        > chunked problem.

    -   John: did you see getitems()? [*Async in
        > zarr*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/536)

    -   Using xarray … with dask.

    -   Josh: would have used nczarr if it were already ready?

    -   Joseph: tried tiledb. Wasn’t far enough along.

-   Upcoming/Future topics

    -   Jonathan: DICOM & Zarr

    -   Josh: Nested+S3 --
