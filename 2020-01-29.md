        > themselves and their interest in zarr/n5.

    -   **Jackson+Jamie**: Allen Institute for Cell Science, deal with
        > "Zeiss" CZI files, have python bindings to "libczi",
        > integrating with Dask, interested in Zarr for storage.

    -   **Ward**: Unidata (Boulder, CO); team lead for netcdf-c
        > (netcdf-java folks v interested in Java-based Zarr impl)

    -   **Ryan**: Mount Sinai School of Medicine in NYC; scRNA-seq biofx
        > → Zarr

    -   **John**: HHMI→Nvidia, lots of image data work → Zarr

-   NumFOCUS / Quansight

    -   discussing Quansight doing contract work related to EOSS grant

        -   James Bourbeau (dask) may be taking this on, but his time is
            limited
        -   But looking for someone to focus on the v3 spec in 2020

    -   Zarr is now a NumFOCUS project!

-   Zarr v2: any open and/or blocked PRs?

    -   Jamie: what features are being added?

    -   John: less adding things and more removing things. E.g. Zarr in
        > Python allows you to store objects

    -   Josh: smaller core with an extension mechanism

    -   [*Zarr v3
        > update*](https://zarr-developers.github.io/zarr/specs/2019/06/19/zarr-v3-update.html)
        > (June 2019)

-   Goal: have OME move a huge amount of archival data to Zarr

    -   today: OME-TIFF; more features desired

    -   some issues keeping XML aligned w/ TIFFs today; possible to put
        > relevant metadata into Zarr, avoid extra level of metadata
        > indirection around Zarr?

    -   recently launched tool for converting out of proprietary formats

        -   Zarr/N5 produced as intermediates
        -   might be interesting to use those as 1st-class

-   NetCDF:

    -   merged 1st code from nc-zarr dev fork into main branch
        > ([*NCZarr*](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/developer/entry/nczarr-overview);
        > [*nczarr-merge.wif
        > branch*](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/tree/nczarr-merge.wif))

    -   Ward hopefully speaking at [*EGU in Vienna in
        > May*](https://egu2020.eu/register_and_venue/registration.html)

    -   John: does it make sense for people writing bindings to look at
        > it before release?

    -   Ward: not sure without speaking to Dennis. Perhaps the next
        > month or two.

-   Opportunities for contributions from Allen Institute folks?

    -   interest in Zarr from C(++)

    -   see: [*z5*](https://github.com/constantinpape/z5) ("Lightweight
        > C++ and Python interface for datasets in zarr and N5 format")

    -   [*zarr-python
        > issues*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

    -   Josh: bioformats2”raw” & metadata pain points

        -   Jamie: in house Python code to parse metadata.
        -   Jackson: hoping to have people writing Zarr ASAP. Dask
            clusters aren’t giving the desired speed up.
        -   [*https://github.com/allencellmodeling/aicsimageio*](https://github.com/allencellmodeling/aicsimageio)

    -   Using it in production and migrating as necessary

-   AOB (Any Other Business)

    -   Josh: Shared gdoc folder. John: use NumFOCUS folder? RyanW: not
        > sure it’s shared. Start off by adding people to the current
        > folder.

    -   [*Here's a "community" gdrive
        > folder*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/144M9w9LQElyu7gMGeT5tpqGvibqZKCJe?usp=sharing)
        > with this doc in it
