# 2024-01-24

**Attending:** Ward Fisher (WF), Sanket Verma (SV), Davis Bennett (DB), GƒÅbor KovƒÅcs (GB), Joe Hamman (JH), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS)

## TL;DR:

Highlights include updates on Zarr activities, such as a sprint in NYC, progress on Zarr-Python refactor, and discussions on codec compatibility and metadata changes for Zarr-Python V3, alongside introductions with favorite foods and considerations for Numcodecs usage and backward compatibility.

**Updates:**

- Zarr Sprint in NYC @ Columbia University - organised by CloudNativeGeo and Earthmover
    - Tweet: <https://twitter.com/cloudnativegeo/status/1734624685105492216>
    - Event: <https://lu.ma/Zarr-NYC>
    - Agenda: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x62xVWxcjJJHQWdNE5jPHkVzh5k6_HfoifUJ9v-AwPA/edit?usp=sharing>
- V3 design doc merged: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1583>
- Zarr-Python refactor group is moving ahead
    - PRs: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3AV3>
- Core-dev off-boarding procedure: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/governance/pull/39>
    - If inactive for 1 year - may be removed or classified as emeritus with majority of vote
- Aiming for 2.16.2 release
    - Need to complete <https://github.com/zarr-developers-/zarr-python/pull/1621>

**Meeting Minutes:**

- DB: Will be opening a new PR which is currently in a new branch
    - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1589> may become unemergeable
- Release: Would like to spread the word about dropping Python 3.8 
- WF: AMS presence taking place in Baltimore
    - JH: Ryan and Joe are going be there
- Introductions w/ favourite food
    - SV: Dumplings
    - JH: CTO at Earthmover; burritos/pizza
    - DB: Independent software contractor; spicy food
    - GB: Research Scientist @ Allen Institute; hungarian sweet
    - WF: Technical team lead @ Unidata; eggs and rice/chicken tikka masala
- JH: Numcodecs in the Zarr-Python world
    - JH: Zarr-Python V3 will have plugin interface (array‚Üíbytes, array‚Üíarray, bytes‚Üíbytes) - There is no array‚Üíarray codec in numcodecs - In V2 codecs live in numcodecs
    - JH: What packages are using numcodecs only?
    - JH: Maybe they're using through Zarr!
    - DB: Adding a ABC codec array bytes
    - JH: Reached out to John, still waiting to hear from him
    - JMS: Downloads for Zarr-Python and numcodecs are good - we should not introduce a backward-incompatibility
    - JMS: Originally designed to have codecs for Zarr - keep numcodecs for backward compatible packages like V2
    - JMS: Changes in metadata b/w V2 and V3 which can be troublesome
    - JH: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/pull/501>
    - JMS: New design depends on what things you want to pass through the codecs
- SV: Martin might be showing up
    - JH: Martin talked with Joe regarding chunk-grid
        - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/discussions/1635>
- SV: Endorse SPEC0
    - JH: No harm on keeping NumPy 1.22
    - JH: Opened a PR to update 1.24 and python 3.10+
        - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1638>
    - SV: Will sync with SP folks and endorse SPEC0
- DB: Spec has different type of codecs - is typing based on the signature
    - JMS: Implementation need to know what type of codec is it
    - DB: Looking at the properties and wondering to add a new type
    - JMS: Neuroglancer has a registry where we lookup for codecs; registries aren't necessary!
    - DB: Creating the registry while adding new codecs can be useful
    - JMS: Example Neuroglancer: <https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/blob/master/src/datasource/zarr/codec/resolve.ts>
    - JH: Would be interesting to get Norman take on this
    - JMS: The design is influenced because of multiple threads and you can only ship bare objects
    - DB: Burns to see type definitions in typescript! üòì
    - JMS: Python has poorly designed type definitions when compared to typescript
- DB: Status of V3 in Neuroglancer?
    - JMS: Definitely pretty complete but have some caveats like handling transpose, etc.
    - JMS: Like handling sharding; probably as good as a source for V3 implementation as anything out there
    - JMS: Tensorstore is also complete; also more general than Neuroglancer
    - DB: Has bias coming from V2; so want to see how others are doing things in a new ecosystem
- TABLED
    - Chat platform discussion
