-   Introductions

-   Topics

    -   C/F ordering

        -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/community/issues/41*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/community/issues/41)

        -   C-ordering is the default (natural in Python)

        -   in Julia, typically looks reverted (in metadata) but without
            transposing it.

            -   Seems to what most people who are doing it are used to
                > this.

            -   But there is confusion if you save in Python (10 rows, 5
                > cols)

            -   when in Julia it’s different.

        -   Ryan: is it important to be able to *write* F-ordered data?

            -   What’s important is what bits are close together not the
                > language convention. May not have understood the
                > issue.

            -   Didn’t transpose but only change the metadata. Then can
                > read as is.

        -   Dennis: fortran impl. reverses the dimensions before it
            calls the C library which gives the correct order for the
            data. netcdf-c stores everything (by default) as row-major
            order. For nczarr, must look at the ordering and then decide
            whether or not to reverse.

        -   Ryan: the fact that it’s in the spec but not supported is a
            problem.

            -   Don’t see the use case for it right now.

        -   ….lots of discussion…

        -   Fabian: remember the reason for F-ordering is because
            compression in some orders is more efficient

        -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/7*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/7)

        -   John: not sure that’s (still) the case, since carefully try
            to **never** transpose.

        -   Dennis: should be talking about column- and row-major
            ordering rather than C/F.

        -   John: need to also discuss with N5

    -   Xtensor-zarr implementation status (Matt)

        -   Being applied here:
            [*https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKIOOMEZarrNGFF*](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKIOOMEZarrNGFF)

            -   API / testing issues in xtensor-zarr

                -   [*https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor-zarr/issues/58*](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor-zarr/issues/58)
                -   [*https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor-zarr/issues/57*](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor-zarr/issues/57)
                -   

        -   Matt: running into some bugs. Working with team in France.

        -   Josh: did you try tensorstore or z5? c++ netcdf is also an
            option.

        -   C++ implementations:

            -   [*https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKIOOMEZarrNGFF/issues/3*](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKIOOMEZarrNGFF/issues/3)

            -   e.g. also
                > [*https://github.com/usnistgov/FastLoader*](https://github.com/usnistgov/FastLoader)

        -   Josh: would love to find a way to share code (Constantin
            could see moving z5py onto xtensor-zarr)

    -   NetCDF WebAssembly support (Matt)

        -   [*https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/pull/2129*](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/pull/2129),
            “Support hdf5debug.c compilation with Emscripten“

            -   Todo: follow-up on netcdf-c repository GitHub
                > Discussions

        -   [*https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-wasm*](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-wasm)

        -   C#, etc.
            [*https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet*](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet),
            [*https://wasmer.io/*](https://wasmer.io/)

        -   Dennis: interested in using WebAssembly (was thinking about
            using it for compressors for Java). Perhaps move to
            discussion section,
            [*https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/discussions*](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/discussions)

    -   Xarray/Zarr (Josh & Jackson, minimally)

        -   BOpen consultants working on:

            -   NetCDF / xarray / Zarr compatibility

            -   Hierarchical support

                -   Data trees
                -   Multiscale conventions in zarr repo:
                -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/125*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/125)

        -   Jackson: aicsimageio only supports xarray for different
            locations (scenes, position or OME:images. some other
            dimension)

            -   then multiscales, i.e. pyramids

            -   datatree stuff should help. we have different groups and
                > they *MAY* have multiscales.

            -   seems like
                > [*https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/4118*](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/4118)
                > would work

            -   don’t know if it’s “enough” for aicsimageio. (Jackon’s)
                > dream would be to have multiple datatrees where each
                > is a position.

            -   Datatree  
                > Dataset (diff position / scene / image)  
                > Resolution 0  
                > Resolution 1_2D …  
                > Resolution 1_3D …  
                > Dataset (diff position…)

Resolution 1

-   Fabian: would be nice to have **multiple chunkings** of the same
    > data (Also from Brockmann Group in their viewer)

-   Jackson: currently do this (fake it) with TIFF, CZI, LIF by allowing
    > the user to say *how* they want to chunk (zyx, tzyx, …)
