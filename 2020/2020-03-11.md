# 11th March, 2020

Attending: Josh, John, Ralf, Martin, James, Joe in Seattle! (20:33)

-   Cancellations

    -   PyCon? Not yet.

-   Quansight SoW

    -   Josh: anything needed? Clarifications?

        -   Ralf: looks ok. As well from Travis.

        -   @Josh to send gdoc to Quansight & NumFOCUS and publish to
            github after ok via email

            -   Cc Leah & ping on slack

    -   James: starting points

        -   John: Reading on zarr-spec
        -   Josh: Perhaps summary of reading to
            [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/16*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/16)

-   Martin: Xpublish:
    [*https://medium.com/pangeo/xpublish-ff788f900bbf*](https://medium.com/pangeo/xpublish-ff788f900bbf)

    -   Possible to do pre-processing to generate chunks on the fly

    -   Discussion versus Intake server happened in pangeo meeting

        -   Overlap. Potentially making them more similar to one
            another.
        -   Similarly similar but more generic. Includes catalogs.

    -   Joe: Fastapi has its own event loop. James added a workaround
        > for jupyter.

        -   [*https://github.com/jhamman/xpublish/issues/7*](https://github.com/jhamman/xpublish/issues/7)
        -   [*Dask Array: Stackoverflow Question*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60492963/computing-dask-array-chunks-asynchronously-dask-fastapi/60493300?noredirect=1#comment107046297_60493300)

-   Martin will work on generic fsspec backend: [*github
    comment*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/373#issuecomment-592722584)

    -   Working on zarr open with fsspec. Few additional methods that
        > could be useful.

    -   Downsides of get_mapper: need to import fsspec, only get raw
        > dictionary i/f (no files backend)

    -   Josh: similar to
        > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/49*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/49)
        > ?

        -   E.g. detecting NestedDirectoryStorage

-   NumPy docs (Josh) → **ISSUE**

    -   [*https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.io.html*](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.io.html)

    -   Any reason to not do it? Ralf: nah.

    -   Ralf: question of which one relies on which one.

    -   Description at the top of the page.

-   EOSS Report: Governance, etc. → **ISSUE**

    -   Ralf: need something more than consensus model of numpy

    -   Josh: Napari example 2 of 3 tie breaker.

        -   Propose 3 of 5 with non-permanent membership
        -   Especially review after the first year.

    -   John: good to discuss. Happy without BDFL.

    -   Committee based: John- conda-forge,

        -   Ralf: steering council alone isn’t enough. Naming of core
            team isn’t great.
        -   **Suggestion**: Steering council (shouldn’t do much), teams
            as they make sense (cf. matplotlib). Code team → Core team.
            Perhaps also API team separate since that pulls in other
            projects like from dask, etc. Smaller concentrated teams
            seem to attract more people.
        -   John: conda-forge has separate for subprojects that they are
            trusted to just solve.

-   Calendar / Subsequent meeting

    -   Josh sent James & Ralf to RyanW. for adding to event

-   AOB (from xpublish)

    -   To go along with zarr.js and xpublish

    -   Ralf: Scipy+numpy in Javascript

    -   John: [*https://github.com/scijs*](https://github.com/scijs)

-   Done: 20:41 UK
