# 9th September, 2020

**Attending: John K, Martin D., Matthias B., Trevor Manzt, Josh Moore,
Ryan Williams, Alistair Miles**

** **

-   Wheels:

    -   Josh: everyone ok for it to move forward? Yeah. People were
        > holding off just because of non-familiarity with wheels in
        > general.

    -   John: trying to get Czaki to maintain

-   Standing items

    -   **Introductions**: new joinees should feel welcome to introduce
        > themselves and their interest in zarr/n5.

    -   Trevor Manz ( twitter.com/trevmanz)

        -   Working on
            [*https://github.com/gzuidhof/zarr.js*](https://github.com/gzuidhof/zarr.js) -
            fly on the wall. (ESM bundle)

        -   Looking for ways that zarr.js can work towards v3.

        -   Josh: Test suite across multiple languages?

            -   Matthias: gathering zarr archives with edge cases and
                > testing round-tripping

            -   John:
                > [*https://github.com/constantinpape/zarr_implementations*](https://github.com/constantinpape/zarr_implementations)

            -   Can be shifted to org.

        -   John: thank you for working on it, Trevor!

        -   Ryan: other implementation?
            [*https://github.com/freeman-lab/zarr-js*](https://github.com/freeman-lab/zarr-js)
            (node-specific)

-   Core

    -   Josh: mostly a heads up --
        > [*https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/pull/73*](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/pull/73)

        -   Storage of objects viz-a-viz the v3 spec.

        -   Josh: n5 implementation is currently looking to serialize
            java.lang.Object (similar to pickle)

        -   Alistair: contact after publishing the v3 spec? Assumed no
            contact was neutral. Work together on common target.

        -   Alistair: we’ll need structured-dtype extensions for v3.

        -   John: complex? Cf. C started without complex type. Can also
            be a structured type

            -   C99 added this -
                > [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_mathematical_functions#complex.h*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_mathematical_functions#complex.h)

        -   [*https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions/complex-dtypes/v1.0.html*](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions/complex-dtypes/v1.0.html) -
            draft protocol extension for complex numbers

    -   Alistair: from last community meeting

        -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/90*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/90)

        -   Q: what do you do about stores that can store metadata
            natively?

        -   Josh: agree that there’s no conflict in v3, but felt there
            was in v2.

        -   Alistair: not if you don’t have one hierarchy but a tree of
            separate documents

        -   Matthias: not as much the storage as the API that you expose
            to users

        -   Martin: lots of opportunities for this. Async of blobs is
            something that may not be in all implementations.

            -   Does that get built into the core library?

            -   Delegated to the storage layer?

            -   Labeled as “experimental”

        -   Matthias: for attributes, way to generate API in python that
            we couldn’t be done in compiled languages (i.e. knowing all
            attributes that exist)

        -   Matthias: also, will such an API generate more traffic?
            (Transaction API)

    -   Matthias: Keep Python 3.5 support until when ? Personally I feel
        > the pain on supporting Python 3.5,

        -   Some syntax (variable type annotation) is 3.6+ only,
            async/await keywords are 3.6+ only

        -    and there a couple of other API, libraries/ libraries
            version that are only available on 3.6+.

        -   Last “bugfix” python 3.5 was Python 3.5.4, Aug. 8, 2017 and
            later versions are “source-only security fixes”.

        -   I understand that many people might be stuck using it. But
            as an open source project, there is a developper and
            contributor cost in keeping this, in particular fixing CI
            failures. For information[* NEP
            29*](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)
            suggests to be 3.6+/ numpy 1.15+ around Jan 2020, 3.7+
            around June 2020. Stable IPython is already 3.7+. And
            earlier version of Zarr will still work on 3.5….

        -   John:
            [*https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches*](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches)

            -   Move to one last release bumping numcodecs

        -   Josh: personally agree, think we need an issue proposing
            based on

            -   [*GOVERNANCE.md*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/governance/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)

        -   Document “we support X versions” (and/or we drop when
            upstream says Y).

            -   Matthias: moving forward there are going to be more
                > releases so “# of versions” may shrink the range.

-   Matthias: If not much happening today can we use this time to review
    > PRs ? There are 36 open PRs. In particular much of refactor and
    > cleaning is in conflict with draft v3 spec impl, but would be
    > useful to make things easier to work on / check, as well as do
    > more refactor cleanup on top.

    -   [*Non-draft
        test-success*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc++draft%3Afalse+status%3Asuccess)

    -   [*Non-draft
        test-pending*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc++draft%3Afalse+status%3Asuccess)
        (most of those are “stuck”, can someone with rights on the repo
        push an empty commit or kick the tests?)

    -   [*Non-draft
        test-failure*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc++status%3Afailure+draft%3Afalse)
        (many of those are marked “WIP”, can maybe convert to draft ?

    -   [*FSStore*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/546/files)
        (Martin)

        -   Josh: big thumbs up

            -   Ah, remember that my tests went missing
            -   Martin: +1, can add an existing test suite

        -   Alistair: consolidated is handled in the store. Handle it
            > above?

            -   Martin: could and would be valid. Fits discussion on
                composable stores
            -   This covers writable consolidated (only good for a
                single threaded)
            -   Wasn’t sure.

    -   Matthias: add close() to base class?

    -   Alistair: nested-storage in FSStore?

        -   Martin: For composability (nested+s3)

        -   Josh: is this something

        -   Alistair: think it would be nice to just have a
            > transform-layer

        -   What about detecting which chunky separator?

            -   Josh: would love to have it!

        -   Trevor: having composable stores sounds interesting. Have
            > been wrapping various image types.

            -   E.g.
                [*https://github.com/manzt/napari-dzi-zarr*](https://github.com/manzt/napari-dzi-zarr)
            -   Not just separator in this case
            -   Alistair: was pretty amazed that N5Store was possible.
                Content-addressable storage can also be handled this
                way.

        -   Martin: agreed that a transformer is beneficial, but still
            > want the argument in FSStore for right now (since it’s
            > been around for a while)

-   **Tabled**

    -   Josh: (perhaps largely for the Pangeo crowd) anyone from OGC to
        talk to about the best way to store spatial indexes in Zarr? In
        higher than 2-dimensions? (Will bring up again next time)
