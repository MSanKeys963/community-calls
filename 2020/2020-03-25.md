            -   

    -   Ryan: NYC, rnaseq background, excited about images

    -   James: soft. eng. at Quansight, working on py tools

    -   John: known entity

-   Martin (anaconda): PoC PR for storing zarr on fsspec backend,
    consolidating the various backends. Rather than various
    directory/nested things, you can write a FSSpec backend. Brings the
    possibility of chaining filesystems (just went in): e.g. remote zip
    and cache it locally for your dask workers. URLs may be complicated,
    so may be best to do it as part of intake to not need to remember
    how to construct the parameters.

    -   -   Nick: related to google drive? Yes. M: gdrive has *an*
            implementation. One problem is the authentication layer,
            e.g. if you need to verify the user via the browser. \[if
            you don’t have developer accounts, etc. etc\]

        -   I.e. getting into a political issue and need to talk to the
            right people.

        -   M: And those libraries keep changing. Unsure who to talk to.

        -   May need to have dask see the external system even if the
            local client can’t.

        -   [*https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html*](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html)
            (documentation coming, dependent filesystems need releasing)

        -   Work on intake has started again, e.g. visualization layer.
            See [*xrviz*](https://github.com/intake/xrviz)

        -   N: did napari look at intake as a reader plugin? Not yet.

        -   M: intake has been discussing a reader plugin architecture
            that could be refactored out (as an interface). Consolidate?
            N: currently using pluggy.

        -   [*https://blog.danallan.com/posts/2020-03-07-reader-protocol/*](https://blog.danallan.com/posts/2020-03-07-reader-protocol/) -
            RFC

            -   N: Napari might be game. Talley: return value may be
                > difficult.

            -   M: Metadata is part of this. Arrays are just another
                > type of thing.

            -   N: need for call about the next generation file loading
                > / api / format?

            -   M: would think many people would want to attend, not
                > sure how to reach them. A link with zarr is seeking
                > protocols for what it does. Will try to do something
                > with the blog post by next week.

            -   N: to invite.

-   Update on spatial coordinates: Nick (Napari) and Matt (ITK) - 20:32
    UTC

    -   See:
        > [*https://github.com/thewtex/spatial-image/tree/spatial-image*](https://github.com/thewtex/spatial-image/tree/spatial-image)

        -   Summary: A multi-dimensional spatial image data structure
            for scientific Python.

            -   X-array + extra constraints

            -   This package defines spatial image metadata, provides a
                > function, is_spatial_image, to verify the expected
                > behavior of a spatial image instance, and provides a
                > reference function, to_spatial_image to convert an
                > array-like, e.g. a NumPy ndarray or a Dask array, to a
                > spatial image.

        -   pyimagej equivalent merged

        -   ITK Python equivalent in released in release candidate

        -   Drafted for first PR:

            -   Purpose

            -   Motivation

            -   Data dimensions

            -   Coordinates

        -   Todo for first PR

            -   Direction

            -   Equation and diagrams for world coordinates

        -   Next PR’s

            -   Multiscale

            -   Other metadata, e.g. units

    -   See:
        > [*https://github.com/napari/napari/projects/10*](https://github.com/napari/napari/projects/10)
        > “World coordinates”

        -   Add scale translate transforms, transform chain class.
            Discussion of generality of transform system, affine,
            deformable, complex chains
        -   For now focus on nD affine, but with possibility to
            generalize.
        -   How would you store this information in a file / zarr?

    -   Notes:

        -   (above all kindly provided by Matt)

        -   Following on from discussions in [*multiscale PR
            \#50*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/50#)

        -   spatial-image PR should be coming soon.

        -   N: do we need to specify all the “components” or just a
            bunch of stuff (after the XYZT)

        -   Martin: as astronomer, other things may be important.

            -   N: expand? Some don’t want those and want other.

            -   Geo/earth-science don’t have x/y but spherical
                > coordinate system. T is probably the only thing that
                > everyone can agree on, though astronomers can disagree
                > there, too. E.g. red-shift.

            -   Josh: the bridge to zarr is perhaps what will we define
                > in terms for describing a ND array

            -   Matt: Additionally, this is Euclidean. I.e.
                > common-constraints so you know what you’re dealing
                > with so you can make optimizations.

            -   Martin: if restricting to rectilinear, then xyzt &
                > freq/energy make sense. Something like ultrasound
                > needs translation to rectilinear.

        -   Matt: in ITK, other dimensions can be non-vector-based, e.g.
            rate tensors, etc.

        -   Lesson-learned: coordinates are stored and compressed
            separately as a 1D array. Another option to be storing it as
            metadata. Could potentially be done better in the zarr spec.

        -   Feedback from CZI guys at the dask workshop: Tony, thinking
            about using this for standards, thinks that filters may be
            more of a bug than a feature. Other languages (JS) have
            difficulty reading such sets. Martin: would be good to
            describe each filter in a language agnostic way. Matt:
            perhaps constraining which filters in the spec?

-   AOB

    -   Ward: netcdf working with zizzle (?) for testing against S3.

        -   community-led organization with meetings, etc.
        -   Hope to have something soon and feedback and fixes for
            within \~ 2 mon. (... last mile concerns)

    -   Goverance

        -   Josh: Please take a look at the governance repository if you
            haven’t
        -   John: can we talk next week?
        -   John: dividing meeting in half. Use-cases 50%; core zarr
            50%? Sounds good.
        -   Josh: where should we post? GitHub is fine.
