Apologies: Martin (**Happy Canada Day!)**

-   Standing items

    -   **Introductions**: new joinees should feel welcome to introduce
        > themselves and their interest in zarr/n5.

-   **Add Community Topics Here**

    -   Ward: travis-ci ~~is~~ had been stuck but … now there’s support
        > for nczarr in master!

        -   ([*https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/pull/1769*](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/pull/1769)
            merged)
        -   Dennis: some more work needed on CMake (esp. Windows)
        -   Josh:

        -   Dennis: and to netcdf developers group

-   FYI / 1 minute update

    -   Josh: Still trying to convert
        > [*hdf2zarr*](https://github.com/joshmoore/zarr-utils/issues)
        > without too much success, plus fighting with [*bool
        > encodings*](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/2937) and
        > [*403 for remote
        > chunks*](https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec/issues/342)

        -   RyanA: some contributors use a compressor for the boolean
            issue

        -   Nothing yet on the zarr side. A numpy problem.

        -   Was able to use delta filters/compressors 1000x

        -   Matthias: do we want to support support data types that are
            less than 8-bits in v3 w/o a compressor / filter

        -   Alistair/John: there is a packbit filter, chained with a
            codec

            -   [*https://numcodecs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packbits.html*](https://numcodecs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packbits.html)

            -   [*https://numcodecs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/delta.html*](https://numcodecs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/delta.html)

    -   [*HDF5Zarr*](https://github.com/catalystneuro/HDF5Zarr) -
        > viewing HDF5 files as Zarr

        -   Josh: was an issue of supporting types

        -   General question of: **should every HDF5 file be
            convertible?**

        -   John: attributes need to be json serializable, so arrays
            aren’t supported.

            -   Could define a mapping, but there are likely performance
                > tradeoffs.

        -   John: similar issues in xarray? Ryan A: haven’t looked at
            that part of the code base. **Stephan Hoyer knows**. (wrote
            backends for xarray)

            -   Relevant xarray code:  
                > [*https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/master/xarray/backends/zarr.py#L247-L252*](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/master/xarray/backends/zarr.py#L247-L252)

        -   Dennis: what’s the use case? Unsure, but generally a small
            numpy that’s been stored as an attribute rather than as a
            dataset.

        -   Stephan joins (repeat

        -   Questions to Stephan

            -   Should we be able to convert any HDF5 files in ZARR, is
                > there an isomorphism.

            -   Are there any changes to the zarr spec to make that
                > easier.

            -   String is one of the harder datatypes. Particularly
                > unicode strings,

        -   SH: handling strings, especially unicode strings, is one of
            the trickier things. HDF has a sane model for strings
            (always encoding attached).

            -   Options:

                -   ASCII
                -   UTF-8

            -   Fixed width & variable width data type, in terms of
                > *encoded* string.

            -   Xarray can write any of that. No native way to write
                > encoded UTF-8 string in Python. No numpy datatype.
                > Unicode strings are 4-bytes. Or Object strings.

            -   Xarray writes into (variable width) numpy object arrays.
                > No type safety. Similar to pandas. Works reasonably
                > well in practice.

            -   In Zarr xarray needs to choose an encoding. Need to
                > review, but use default python encoding. Doesn’t use

            -   Matthias: isn’t UTF-8 variable width?

            -   Stephan: yes, but it’s the max width of the *encoded*
                > size. Cf. Julia model. (whereas Python is more
                > UTF-32-like)

            -   Dennis: can also null terminate (even if not legal)

        -   Josh: worth trying H5Zarr \[bypasses netcdf library\] ?
            **SH**: Challenge is that xarray requires the named
            dimensions. As long as you have dimension scales, then it
            should be able to convert.

        -   SH: having a built string type would be worth thinking about
            (only at the numcodecs layer)

        -   Alistair: certainly thinking that that would be a
            high-priority extension (**Text**). Copy HDF5 model? SH: for
            fixed-width data, it’s a pretty good model. Alistair: and
            for variable width strings? SH: Also good, but more complex.
            Depends on the complexity of variable width data in zarr in
            general.

        -   John: does storing arrays in attributes happen in xarray?
            SH: yes, but I don’t think it’s very useful.

        -   Dennis:

            -   Attributes are one dimensional arrays of variable length

            -   Attributes are type (not in Zarr; hence the extra
                > metadata)

-   **Add Core Topics Here**

    -   Matthias Questions:

        -   Which approach do you prefer for zarr v3:

            -   A complete separate import submodule and utility
                > functions ?

            -   Try to weave v3 in the current classes and utilities
                > functions ?

                -   Some refactor of v2 will likely be needed (and
                    stared), in particular try to be a bit stricter on
                    internal types would help.also around attributes
                    that are currently their own key, and would not be.

            -   Ryan A: in xarray, passes thing to \`open_store\` (never
                > open groups, though it may be changing to use
                > introspection

            -   PR in progress:  
                > [*https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/4187*](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/4187)

            -   Josh: an use of namespaces with {zarr, zarr2, zarr3}

            -   Matthias: concerned about the isinstance() uses., but
                > depends on what API usage you allow

            -   Matthias: *almost* have xarray loading v3 spec without
                > touching xarray

            -   RyanA: could add a new CI branch to pull the V3 spec

            -   Matthias: cool, but currently choking on attributes.
                > *Does* work with a V2 adapter.

`Image 3`

-   -   -   Lots of magic to support bytes/bytes array/ memory view/ …

            -   Could we have a single internal type more often?

            -   (e.g. ConsolidatedStore doesn’t do one thing ….)

            -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/574*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/574)

    -   From Martin in absentia: “*I can report that fsspec's mapper
        > class has acquired the methods "getitems", "setitems" and
        > "delitems", which will be implemented in async/concurrent when
        > possible. This already works for HTTP (read-only), and I am
        > doing GCS/S3 next.*”

    -   SH: been using Zarr recently. Very enjoyable. Kudos!
