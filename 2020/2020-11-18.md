# 18th November, 2020

**Attending:**

Matthias Bussonnier, Jim Pivarski, Eric Pelman, Martin Durant, Ryan
Williams,

Ryan Abernathey, Josh Moore

-   Josh: Thoughts on

    -   [*mat files*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/community/issues/16):
        > any parser at all? Not even JSON.

        -   Martin: why? … Matthias: via Julia.
        -   Ryan: biggest elephant is R. Biggest problem.

    -   [*Apache Arrow*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/515)

        -   Josh: movement towards needing interlinks. Can handle it at
            the metadata layer, but wondering if it’s of interest at the
            zarr layer.
        -   Martin: or awkward array did the reverse. Task: store an
            awkward thing in zarr (all structured as one dimensional
            things) Pretty fast. No problems. But the python arrow
            implementation is difficult to walk through a nested
            structure. Unclear if this is a good idea. (Parquet is
            designed to do this) Arrow doesn’t support anything nested
            other than list-of-lists.
        -   POC to show that you can (if there’s some convention)
        -   Jim: “shredding” if you get things that don’t make sense on
            their own.

    -   s3 difficulties across language implementations (re: netcdf-c)

        -   For Pangeo Python+big 3+non-public data

        -   Eric: lots of edge cases. Often a one line change (e.g. http
            403 vs 404)

        -   Josh: Difficulties with AWS-SDK-C++ etc.

        -   Ryan: motivation behind tiledb cloud (proprietary platform)
            is the challenge of IAM “stuff”. We need integration test

        -   [*https://github.com/constantinpape/zarr_implementations*](https://github.com/constantinpape/zarr_implementations)

            -   But not cross-product with the different cloud providers

            -   Martin: supposed to be learning rust. Could implement
                > fsspec in rust → c → call it from anything.

            -   Matthias: separate store vs. zarr protocol.

            -   Ryan: what does that look like in C?

            -   Matthias: communication issue. Not a zarr issue. But a
                > SDK issue.

            -   Josh: will look into adding something to z_i that fails
                > to show the problem. Think we’re setting netcdf-c up
                > to fail.

        -   Ryan: cloud permissions. Pre-signed URLs! Key element to
            make private data accessible without going through cloud
            providers credential system. (json-web-token) NASA doesn’t
            want all users to need s3 credentials. Little lambda-based
            API generates URLs for users. Want to do the same thing for
            zarr … but a million objects.

        -   Eric: great use case for the dense format with an index
            file. Martin: don’t think there’s a problem with a million
            hash files. Ryan: interested in the latency.

        -   Ryan: need a standalone zarr-cloud-provider-framework

        -   Matthias: tension in the spec. Is a store more than a
            mutable mapping? If you want more features, then stores need
            to be more complicated than k/v.

        -   Ryan: Zarr as an API. We’re using HTTP/S3 + paths as a
            defacto API. good to encourage others doing things under the
            hood. Mention it in the spec?

-   Ryan: file chunk store:

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/556*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/556)

    -   How do we move forward?

    -   Josh: trevor will have reduced capacity

    -   Ryan: can we agree on the process? Common use-case amongst
        > multiple fields where we want to access chunks within a binary
        > file, map them to an array or group. Unlocks cool hacks. Can
        > we agree on the data structure, then others can go off and
        > make creative things. In geospatial, 100s of PBs in netcdf
        > that shouldn’t be converted.

    -   Eric: index file specification or an API where you plugin in
        > code to do the hash table lookup to calculate the offset.
        > Ryan: could you encode the hash table somehow

    -   Martin: not specifically zarr-centric. “How to treat
        > byte-offsets/ranges as a filesystem?” Ryan: it’s a type of
        > store. Martin: It’s a type of *filesystem*. Matthias: a level
        > beyond zarr. Ryan: data formatted this way should follow some
        > specification so we can work together.

    -   See
        > [*https://github.com/intake/fsspec-reference-maker*](https://github.com/intake/fsspec-reference-maker)

        -   Josh: potentially add templates with some form of function
        -   Eric: prefixes to reference another json (i.e. breaking it
            up)
        -   Ryan: consider it a success if a few people open issues to
            demonstrate that others (beyond Ryan & Martin) are engaged.
        -   Need a version number.

-   Josh: [*n5
    compression*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/577)

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/issues/73*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/issues/73)

    -   Eric: how do you document the dimension restrictions?

    -   John: see
        > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/blob/master/numcodecs/lzma.py#L17*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/blob/master/numcodecs/lzma.py#L17)
        > on how to specify parameters
