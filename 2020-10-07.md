-   Zarr 2.5 release both on PyPI and Conda-forge, last version to be
    Python 3.5 compatible. I merged the PR removing testing and Python
    3.5 conditional branches a few minutes ago, so master is 3.6 only.
    That should mean CI will be much faster.
-   Python 3.9 has been released this week, so it will be on
    conda-forge, travis, ...etc relatively soon, we’ll need to enable it
    in CI.

-   Added Codecov
-   Cut meeting short since there wasn’t too much to discuss this week
