Apologies:

-   Standing items

    -   **Introductions**: new joinees should feel welcome to introduce
        > themselves and their interest in zarr/n5.

    -   Stephan W-C (Zeiss): have wanted to join for some time.
        > Interested in using Zarr for microscopy, and possibly support
        > it moving forward.

    -   Chris Roat (?): started 8-9 months ago, had heard
        > xarray/zarr/dask for parallel computing. Also use neuroglancer
        > in the backend.

    -   Tyler: work with Chris as a PhD student. Reluctant HDF5 user.
        > Interested in cross-language support. (e.g. MATLAB, Julia)
        > Ryan A: julia supports zarr, but not feature parity. Matthias:
        > could import Python until feature complete.

    -   Andrew Fulton (Quansight): introduced by James.

    -   Matthias (Quansight): around for 3 weeks. Working on v3 spec.
        > And fixing bugs. Performance optimizing.

    -   Ben Dichter (NWB): HDF5 as primary backend. Exploring Zarr as a
        > secondary backend.

    -   Matt McCormick: work with Ben, some NWB but imaging in general.

    -   ...old folks introduce themselves...

-   NWB: [*Evaluate Zarr as a possible alternate array data / storage
    backend*](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues/230) -
    20:11 UK

    -   Ben: goal of NWB is to create entire neurophysiology experiment
        > (h/w, measurements, …) i

    -   Resources:

        -   [*Nwb schema*](https://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        -   [*NWB HDF5
            Storage*](https://nwb-storage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/storage_hdf5.html)
        -   [*NWB Specification
            Language*](https://schema-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

    -   .e. recording live animal activity with microscopy/probes

        -   Data typically for one experiment. Nearly impossible to
            share data. Often easier to re-record. Trying to solve that
            problem.

        -   Technically: (1) could just use zarr as a new backend. HDF5
            works well with **links, region references,** etc. Timeline
            for those features? (2) reading HDF5 file using zarr.

            -   NWB uses the hdmf abstraction over HDF5
                > [*https://hdmf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/*](https://hdmf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

        -   Ryan: might want to to check out [*Cloud-Performant Reading
            of NetCDF4/HDF5 Data Using the Zarr
            Library*](https://medium.com/pangeo/cloud-performant-reading-of-netcdf4-hdf5-data-using-the-zarr-library-1a95c5c92314)

        -   Matt: are there bindings in MATLAB?

            -   Nick: is anyone talking to MATLAB? Jonathan: can also
                > link up from the NVIDIA side.

            -   Josh: would be great to have MATLAB reading zarr but
                > likely C layer would be the best route → nczarr?

            -   Dennis: R, MATLAB have often relied on NetCDF to do the
                > heavy lifting.

        -   John: looked at links or region references via nczarr?
            Dennis: if it’s not in the spec then NetCDF won’t implement
            it. I.e. being narrow in the implementation or spec-driven.

            -   John: could conceivably use symlinks with
                > DirectoryStore. But cloud?

            -   Martin: no general mechanism

            -   Dennis: particular extension for HDF5?

            -   some existing discussion of links/references in Zarr:
                > [*\#389*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/389)

            -   John: in cloud could potentially have metadata that
                > points to the data, but wouldn’t work for hard
                > references.

            -   Dennis: have avoided links that form a cycle

            -   Martin: NetCDF is a nicer thing to mirror than all of
                > HDF5.

            -   Ben on the use of links: workaround would probably be
                > ok. E.g. have a generic time-series structure. Don’t
                > want the user to duplicate the timestamps but it
                > *looks* like they exist in many places.

            -   Ben: also use references as attributes extensively.
                > Table structure which corresponds to putative neurons.
                > Want to link those to the electrodes. An attribute on
                > one of the datasets to a group formalizes that link.

            -   RyanA: xarray allows this at least currently in a single
                > group. Ben: that would currently be a major refactor.
                > RyanA: no easier answer, doesn’t currently go up or
                > down the tree.

            -   John: using hard links? NAFAIK, but *also *external
                > links.

        -   Alistair: if there’s a way to achieve what you want without
            adding protocol extensions, worth exploring (depending on
            cost). But if you need internal soft-links or region
            references, then those are likely implementable as
            extensions. Defining conventions for storing it in metadata.
            Could explore doing so as extensions to v2 and getting those
            added to zarr-python as a short-term option. Likely no core
            bandwidth for that since there’s a focus on the v3 spec.
            Ben: and v3? May be easier, since v2 doesn’t have a concept
            of the root of a hierarchy making relative links difficult.
            V3 is ongoing for the rest of this year.

            -   Delineation between extensions and conventions. Cf.
                > multiscale discussion recently:
                > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/50*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/50)

-   DMH: I have put up some documentation for the nczarr netcdf
    implementation here (I hope it is accessible):
    [*NCZARR.md*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UUGcQMpWqKllMdRFCu97CoL7fB_GWXvg/view?usp=sharing)

    -   RPA: I made a hack-md version:  
        > [*https://hackmd.io/@rabernat/r1yYQZmsU*](https://hackmd.io/@rabernat/r1yYQZmsU)

    -   RPA: Done or up for discussion? DMH: Up for discussion. First
        > experimental implementation (stake in the ground). Also want
        > to move to v3 spec as soon as possible, but want to surface
        > problems as soon as possible.

-   RPA (5 min): document xarray Zarr encoding conventions:  
    [*http://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/internals.html#zarr-encoding-specification*](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/internals.html#zarr-encoding-specification)

    -   RyanA: xarray requires this at the moment, but was the only
        > extension.

    -   Josh: NB- will soon reach the same issue in (light-)microscopy
        > space but won’t be purely in the xarray space.

    -   Dennis: you can simulate it for a zarr that’s missing it.
        > Implies sameness where there may not be any semantically. E.g.
        > “dim10”. Considered going to an attribute for this. Decided to
        > not do that due to scalability. Basically removes laziness due
        > to how zarr stores attributes. Used a separate object.

        -   RyanA: good point. Known to be a hack. **But** have a
            petabyte of data formatted like this, will nczarr be able to
            read it?

        -   Dennis: Have many hacks for supporting the diversity of
            OpenDAP servers. Willing to add special cases if needed for
            backwards compatibility.

        -   RyanA: realized that we made a mistake in just hard-coding
            without specifying. Not particularly interoperable, but now
            trying to get there. Hopefully superceded by future specs.

        -   Dennis: need to be careful about naming. NetCDF tries to
            interpret underscore attributes. Next time perhaps consider
            a new namespace.

        -   RyanA: should make named dimensions as simple/interoperable
            as possible.

        -   Dennis: would guess that’s a top candidate for adding to the
            v3 spec.

        -   Alistair: core metadata? Additionally, v3 puts attributes
            along with array metadata, based on what n5 was doing. Now
            is the time to challenge that. DMH: challenge! due to
            **scalability**. E.g. reading 10Ks of file for very specific
            information, like a coordinate. Dennis: was mostly worried
            about the consolidated approach.

        -   Matthias: storing attributes in even *more* files?...
            Dennis: that then proliferates objects. Alistair: trade-off
            in cloud storage in latency.

        -   RyanA: difference in use of zarr and netcdf -- take 1000s of
            netcdfs and turn it into 1 zarr fileset. Somewhat mitigates
            problem of reading thousands of different files.

        -   DMH: thought dataset was a bucket.

            -   [*https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/cmip6*](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/cmip6)

            -   [*https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/cmip6/CMIP/CAS/CAS-ESM2-0/amip/r2i1p1f1/Amon/tas/gn/*](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/cmip6/CMIP/CAS/CAS-ESM2-0/amip/r2i1p1f1/Amon/tas/gn/)

            -   DMH: then you can have nested datasets… (works for pure
                > Zarr but not for xarray)

    -   (notes only) Josh: have been watching the rechunking threads.
        > Will give this a try for terabyte scale image arrays.

-   Matthias: Some questions about spec v3, fallback dtype for
    extensions … Should I start work with on a draft implementation that
    we update as the spec goes.
