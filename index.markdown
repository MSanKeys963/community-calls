Zarr community meetings take place every two weeks where maintainers,
contributors and the overall general community get together generally for an
hour to discuss ongoing issues, features, bugs, processes or anything important
for the development and progress of [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/). The agenda for the meeting is open
and anyone can add items to it. The standing agenda for the community meeting
is mentioned above.

Notes from the previous meetings can be accessed using the sidebar. 👈🏻

We’re always looking to discuss new ideas, implementations, research or anything
of interest to Zarr. If you think you have something to share with the Zarr
community please join us via this [link](https://zoom.us/j/300670033?pwd=OFhjV0FHQmhHK2FYbGFRVnBPMVNJdz09). New contributors looking for tips and
guidance are most welcome to join us. We’d be more than happy to reserve a slot
for them at the end of the meeting.
