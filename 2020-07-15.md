Apologies: Josh (bike tour),

-   Regular[* v3 spec development
    call*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/community/issues/33) -
    trying to find a new time-zone-friendly time, please respond to
    [*this doodle*](https://doodle.com/poll/76syg3ycbuuyebdg) if you'd
    like to attend

-   v3 spec development process - [*straw man
    proposal*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/13) -
    raise briefly for discussion

-   [*https://github.com/napari/napari/*](https://github.com/napari/napari/)
    (some integration with Zarr during SciPy sprint)

-   Issue for discussion of expanded character set for node names:
    [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/56*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/56)
    and see also discussion of case insensitivity in
    [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/57*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/57)

    -   Dennis: argues for supporting UTF8 in node names

    -   Matthias: maybe zarr v3 spec could recommend that stores use the
        > same normalisation, but don't say exactly what normalisation

    -   Dennis: getting stores to deal with encoding and normalisation
        > seems OK. Maybe also recommend a normalisation. At least two
        > different kinds of normalisation

    -   \[discussion of case insensitivity and mac file systems\]

    -   Alistair: in favour of requiring stores to be case sensitivity

    -   Martin: mac case insensitivity is in file system driver
        > (probably)

    -   Dennis: in that case no way around, mac users with case
        > insensitive file systems will have problems

    -   Martin: agreed things will fail in some cases, but need to be
        > more explicit about that will happen

    -   Matthias: worried about recommending normalisation

-   Gcsfs now has async bulk ops (including in the mapper
    get/set/delitems); http also done (read-only) and s3fs on the way.
    On master (needs master fsspec too).

    -   Alistair: Any throttling of concurrent requests?

    -   Martin: no.

    -   \[...\]

    -   Matthias: context manager to indicate that a set of operations
        > can be collected together?

    -   Martin: fsspec does have idea of transaction.
