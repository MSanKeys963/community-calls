Matthias Question: Base store for all the stores:

-   Many tests rely on behavior of “dict()”, where “MemoryStore” fails
    > (for example “Requires Parents”, … etc, which one is the “correct”
    > behavior ? is anyone using \`dict()\`, outside of the tests ?

-   Some other weird things with the consolidated metadata store that I
    > have to understand better.

-   Josh: some concern about userspace breakage if expecting the base
    > class internally.

-   John: originally used dict() since it’s the easiest thing that
    > should work.

-   Martin: different code paths based on fallbacks where methods don’t
    > exist. But tests *should* work even with MemoryStore

-   Matthias: detecting listable based on existing methods. Perhaps we
    > could make that an explicit attribute rather than checking for the
    > existence of methods.

-   Can someone post a url for the MemoryStore API? \[dmh\]

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/master/zarr/storage.py#L513*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/master/zarr/storage.py#L513)

-   Alistair: people should be able to use a dict if they want to (a
    > superset of what a store must report). Matthias: except for
    > listdir(). Martin: there are other MutableMappings that someone
    > may want to use with zarr.

-   John: useful to support MutableMapping. Azure for example can just
    > implement a standard Python thing.

-   Alistair: open immediately.

-   Matthias will implement a Store Wrapper that takes mutable mapping
    > and exposes a Store will more methods.

Moving forward with a 2.5 release that is Python 3.5 compatible ?

-   Alistair: any other (small/contained) PRs to get in? (Tend to prefer
    > infrequent releases)

-   Matthias:
    > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/586*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/586)
    > (looks good but seem to decrease coverage, would like a second +1)

-   Try to enable [*https://codecov.io/*](https://codecov.io/)

[*https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html#release-procedure*](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html#release-procedure)
also look at pushing to GitHub releases.

-   Matthias: use gpg keys locally? Not necessary. Alistair: tend to use
    > the “create tag” UI functionality.

Matthias: Reschedule Friday meetings?

-   John to send out a doodle.
