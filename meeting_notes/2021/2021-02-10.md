-   Greetings from Alistair! (Josh)

-   Quansight check-in (Ryan, Ralf, etc.)

    -   Extension until end of March (40k to consume)

    -   Matthias: few hours per week (hard for someone else to ramp up)

        -   Few PRs to rebase and get in

    -   Ralf: few other people who could jump in.

    -   Various Java efforts (nczarr-c, JZarr, n5)

    -   Ralf: is Matthias blocked on feedback

    -   Get on a call with Alistair

    -   Final report May 1

-   Community

    -   Rust & Zarr implementation interoperation

        -   Chris: Status.
            [*rust-pyn5*](https://github.com/pattonw/rust-pyn5) bindings
            around rust-n5.
            [*h5py_like*](https://github.com/clbarnes/h5py_like)-compatible.
            Designs on other chunked backends. Zarr v3 (\~maybe v2). In
            a separate repo, but Andrew is driving that.

        -   Low-level repo has a portion with zarr v3 as of a couple of
            months ago.

        -   Issues with flexibility with the protocol. Didn’t meld with
            rust idioms. (Knowledge of components) (up and downstream)

        -   Matthias: numcodec implementation? All is handled in rust.
            Based on available crates. i.e. only support a subset. (Not
            all implementations are great)

        -   As much as possible in rust. Attribute metadata access is in
            python.

        -   See also [*n5-wasm*](https://github.com/aschampion/n5-wasm)
            (also neuroglancer pre-computed). Interop between javascript
            and wasm is difficult (handling of ndim arrays)

        -   Matthias: Cryptography

            -   Especially an issue on some platforms (like HPC,
                > docker+alphine)

            -   [*https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771#issuecomment-775038889*](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771#issuecomment-775038889)

            -   [*https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html)

            -   HPC being done with Java & Spark so haven’t run into it
                > yet

        -   John: which use cases for rust? currently being deployed on
            both ends of image browsing. On server to read n5 volumes
            into jpeg tiles on the fly. In the browser for a tool that
            looks at a lot of jpeg/n5 files. Nothing super-high
            through-put.

        -   (Andrew joins)

        -   Josh: potential for sharing an implementation & wrap. Sure.
            At least as much as C. Not great for introspection. But
            pretty versatile.

        -   Josh: v3 as a subset of n5? AC: zarr does more than n5-use
            cases need. (Need to work with KLB and other formats) Zarr
            := uniform interface to similar emerging specs but also be
            plastic & versatile (extensibility)

        -   AC: Rust doesn’t have a great dynamic linking story. Not
            sure how a python interface on top of rust is going to work.

        -   MB: makes sense that extension are at compile time. That’s
            why they should all be listed in the top-level metadata.

        -   JK: 2 things entangled

            -   If I make an implementation, do I add the functionality

            -   Do they live in one binary or in multiple.

        -   CB: data communication to user whether or not its readable

        -   nczarr? Can use rust library. Rust library can’t use C
            library due to wasm exporting.

        -   AC: best implementation to work against?
            [*Zarrita*](https://github.com/alimanfoo/zarrita) or
            [*xtensor-zarr*](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor-zarr)

        -   Josh: Assume
            [*https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/*](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/)
            is the working version.

        -   AC: working version is in [*https://github.com/sci-rs/zarr
            *](https://github.com/sci-rs/zarr)

        -   JK: Spec issues tracked here:
            [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues)
