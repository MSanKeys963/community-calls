-   -   Should be simple; needs C.

    -   Would want to have a graph on top of sparse

        -   (both of those are hard)

    -   Looking for a binary format for sparse dataset

    -   Interest? Can always do own thing but …

    -   Timelines: meeting at HPC this year (connecting to other
        > researchers)

        -   next spring will cover more of it

    -   Josh: do any of the GitHub issues cover it?

        -   EW: still higher-level at the moment.

    -   Greg: was looking at WSI slide data (75% background)

        -   There’s a PR to not save those chunks
        -   EW: scipy.sparse has block-compressed storage

    -   Erik: start with v2 or v3?

        -   Josh: as with multiscales probably best to start with v3

-   Ward

    -   screensharing poster

    -   UCAR interns presented posters a week or two ago

    -   [***fsspec-reference-maker***](https://github.com/intake/fsspec-reference-maker)**:**
        > pre-processing HDF to make it look like Zarr

    -   Rich Signell & Martin Durant

    -   Josh: also presented to HUG. :thumbsup:

        -   Will be interesting to see what other languages we can get
            it implemented in

    -   Ward: resource limited. focusing on compression. but glad others
        > are doing.

    -   Tobias: HTTP proxy server which does range requests

        -   See Trevor’s implementations
        -   reference maker is maybe an opportunity to standardize

-   Tobias:

    -   some interesting calls with **IPFS**

    -   IPFS devs are interested in getting involved.

    -   Not really from the zarr-python side. (more fsspec)

    -   but there will be a question for other languages.

    -   Matt: thanks for IPFS package. (good to have better support)

        -   looking at CAR (tar file for IPFS)

        -   similar to reference spec. pointers to similar locations.

        -   Tobias: CAR is serialization format for multiple blocks.

            -   each block may not be larger than 1 MB.

            -   but there is a backend (badgerds) to store multiple
                > blocks in one file

        -   Matt: number of inodes

        -   Tobias: I’ve currently 120GB IPFS data on laptop, trying to
            ramp up amount of data. 100 TBs+ should be fine according to
            IPFS/filecoin people

    -   Josh: https://webknossos.org/ wanting a sharded format

        -   but also Caterva
            ([*https://blosc.github.io/caterva-scipy21/#/16*](https://blosc.github.io/caterva-scipy21/#/16))

    -   Tobias: block size limit is for blocks in flight (for
        > verification) but not for on disk.

-   Matt

    -   looking into adding xarray & dimension separator

    -   xarray not working

    -   see
        > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/773*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/773)

-   Josh:

    -   CSharp?

        -   Ward: no specific CS expertise here but should be able to
            link to shared objs

        -   Hailey: faster to get started with netcdf-c

        -   Matt: good support for native loading. but needs managing.

            -   starting on such a project. compile netcdf-c to WASM

            -   helps with cross-platform issues.

            -   Dennis: piece missing is something like **libc**
                > (fileio, etc.)

            -   Matt: emascripten is one library. system calls is WASI
