Agenda:
- TM: https://excalidraw.com/ for making graphic representations, TM used them for the Zarr [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bKE3BYp9FEPcL7ZUyWkyyguRE5ptSiJYHDqcIn_nmkU/edit?usp=sharing) ðŸ–¼
- `fill_value` for empty chunks:
    - DV: How could it implemented to avoid breaking changes?
    - DV: Whether there is a clear description about `fill_value` in Zarr Spec V2?
    - JK: V3 spec aims to mitigate the issue of `fill_value` and have clear text about it
    - DV: Haven't looked at V3 but if it specifices `fill_value` by default then it's good
    - TM: Not writing `fill_value` is sematically correct, on the implementations side: having to implement something like this is more flexible and easy in JS as compared to Python
    - DV: Problems representing numbers as `.json` metadata. There should not be constraints to `fill_data`/`fill_value` in `.json` as it's metadata
    - TM: Serialising the scalar arrays as containers
    - JK: Slightly hard to read metadata with `fill_value` as there are amiguity issues
    - JK: How does NetCDF handles `fill_value`?
    - WF: Couple of different approaches to handle it.
        - We do it for standard and compound data types
        - In absence of user-input we have a default `fill_value`
        - Mostly users need to specify the data type as it's difficult to come up with it on it's own
        - There's also a flag tp supress `fill_value`
        - As NetCDF is mostly used for data archival and for that we need to maintain data integrity, it's difficult to know what's done if there are no defined data types or no `fill_values`
        - We can also explicitly write `fill_value`
        - Store in metadata
        - JK: Is there a concept of not storing it?
        - WF: `fill_value` can be changed, the default behaviour is to replace old `fill_value` to new `fill_value`, not the best case but yeah, it is what it is!
- TM: `FSSPEC` reference ability to record `base64` to `.json`. How data `URLS` work: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs
- SV: Conferences ðŸ“£
    - BP: Speaking at [ESIP](https://2022esipjulymeeting.sched.com/info)(in-person) on July 19th-22nd on cloud processing and how they process internal Zarr & COGs data at NASA. Christine will be talking about Zarr and almost 50% of the content will be focused on Zarr. Link: [1](https://2022esipjulymeeting.sched.com/event/12etJ) and [2](https://2022esipjulymeeting.sched.com/event/12etV)
    - WF: Will be talking about NCZarr in Rocky Mountain(hybrid), current state of NetCDF. Link to follow in the Gitter chat.
    - JK: GTC(virtual) happened in spring, NVIDIA is presenting a few things at SciPy
    - SV: CFP for EuroSciPy is open until 6/6 AoE, submit [here](https://www.euroscipy.org/2022/program.html)
