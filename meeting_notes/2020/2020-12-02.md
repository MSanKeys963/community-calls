Attending: Jamie Sherman, Ryan Abernathy, Josh Moore, Matthias
Bussonnier, Ryan Williams, Jim Pivarski, John Kirkham

-   Josh workshop:

    -   API maybe the partial read; instead of having multipld copies;
        > can each chunk be compressed in a better way (progressive
        > JPEG) how would that look like to a user.

    -   Could be implemented as a codec

    -   Ryan: premature optimization. Zarr is focused on scale out; this
        > seems low-level optimization.

    -   Josh did selling of rechunk, peoples are quite happy.

<!-- -->

-   Zarr 2.6.1 released; first version to be 3.6+ only. Screwup with
    2.6.0 which was actually published as 0.0.0 due to build isolation
    and setuptools_scm, waiting for the conda-forge bots.

-   CZI EOSS next wednesday (1900 UTC next Wednesday)

    -   Matthias rehearse :

-   Changing fill value (Matthias for Ryan)

    -   easier way to do it.

    -   expose as property on the array, print warning on setting

    -   John: expose is good. warning should include previous.

    -   Josh: will it change which chunks will be written to disk? No.

    -   Matthias: assume the use case is changing after creation before
