# 10th March, 2021

Attendees: Josh Moore, Norman Fomferra, Matthias Bussonnier, Matt
McCormick, Sabine Embacher, Haily Johnson, Ward Fisher, John Kirkham,
Ryan Williams

-   Misc

    -   How many people on Python 3.9? Josh … Matthias: 3.10 is coming.

-   Introductions (noting new folks only)

    -   Hailey (Unidata). Zarr for netcdf

    -   Norman (tech lead, bcdev): working with pydata tech. stack,
        > incl. xarray. Using zarr all day.

-   Community

    -   Unidata java branch: didn’t have distributed file reading. Just
        > now working (Don’t follow Hailey’s branch). AWS S3, … and zip
        > files.

        -   jzarr supports: blosc (native) and zlib (in java)
        -   https://maven-nar.github.io/

    -   Javascript-land: experiments towards NGFF (Matt)

        -   working on supporting other dimension order
        -   supporting also ML libraries, …
        -   Found that it was also needed to pre-compute the range of
            values
        -   https://github.com/Kitware/itk-vtk-viewer
        -   https://github.com/gzuidhof/zarr.js
        -   https://github.com/ome/ngff
        -   Matt to create an ngff issue.

    -   nczarr release (Ward) i.e. C-land

        -   non-zarr issues should be fixed. hard to find. easy to fix.
        -   few bit issues, but hopeful to have 4.8.0 released this week
        -   survey of computing & development environments where zarr is
            being used
        -   netcdf support linux/win/mac/32bit/64bit for **archiving**.
            file written on each needs to be readable by the others.
            (...arm!...)
        -   https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations
        -   spreadsheet:
            [*https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1MpqyzIX_DIEiQwtpSg-9IntICip4ESCErrW_Dn5S7Qk/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=103669694493794058959*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1MpqyzIX_DIEiQwtpSg-9IntICip4ESCErrW_Dn5S7Qk/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=103669694493794058959)

    -   Norman: zarr-specs / multiscales use-case

        -   Matt: downsampling reduces the range so useful to have the
            original range above. xarray.to_zarr isn’t multiscale, but
            adding the representation. allows to use geospatial tools in
            a seamless way.

        -   Norman: multi-uses cases for multiscale representations.
            developing xcube toolset. as well as xcube viewer.

        -   **Coupled problem** (with ESA) -- climate change initiative.
            20 essential variables & \~500TB data. published by THREADSS
            -- produce million of chunks, many HTTP requests. Would like
            to ideally have chunks that are 10s - 100s of MBs. But
            clients need max few MB.

            -   Matt: dealing with the same things. Would like to work
                > together on xcube.

            -   Josh:
                > [*https://github.com/intake/fsspec-reference-maker/pull/17*](https://github.com/intake/fsspec-reference-maker/pull/17)

                -   Matt: Create index files of all the different
                    chunks. Access with HTTP range requests. (Running
                    into the same problem with security URLs)
                -   [*https://twitter.com/rsignell/status/1338550348538138624*](https://twitter.com/rsignell/status/1338550348538138624)

            -   Matthias:
                > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/667*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/667)
                > partial read might help as well to read only part of a
                > big tile.

            -   Matthias: Zarr v3 should also do less requests for deep
                > hierarchies. Also concurrent get()s: multiget().
                > Norman: async? Matthias: zarr isn’t completely
                > async-compatible yet.

                -   https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/606
                    (multiget, end of September.)

            -   Hailey: have a service to group all the requests
                > together.

        -   Norman: making use of the fact that chunks can be missing
            (v2). No change.

-   Core concerns

    -   v3 spec status

        -   Matthias’ branches
        -   Alistair & editor’s draft

    -   Funding (EOSS 4)

        -   Note that

            is now in 2 steps process with first a Letter of intent 1000
            words. (deadline March 30)

        -   How to deal with variable length things.
        -   Josh: haven’t tested variable length
