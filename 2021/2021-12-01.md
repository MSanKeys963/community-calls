# 1st December, 2021

Attending: Josh M., Gregg L, Davis B., Hailey J., John K., Ward F., Ryan
W.

-   [***Sharding***](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/876)

    -   Davis: excited about the implementation

    -   Josh: anything you would change?

        -   Davis: listen to what Jeremy is saying (pretty
            authoritative)
        -   No group metadata in neuroglancer pre-computed
        -   see his tensorstore implementation

    -   JM: Worth chatting with Jeremy? DB: dialog with scalableminds,
        > looks like it’s wondering

    -   JM: also thinking about investigating sharding in V3 (as an
        > extension)?

        -   GL: would need to look at whether or not it’s in place. have
            implemented the necessary methods, but that’s not a
            guarantee.

-   Logo: pink!

    -   Should be finalized soon.

-   HJ: poster coming

    -   add to https://zarr-developers.github.io/? Sure.

-   WF: handing proposal draft in the next few hours!!

    -   also another poster (compression plugin implementation)

    -   JM:
        > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/issues/298*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/issues/298)
        > FYI

    -   WF: collaborating with NOA UC Irvine, etc. on lossy compression
        > codec

-   for GL: when to do 2.11?

    -   PRs opened is everything for V3 (part 6 has all of it)

    -   Store V3, then attributes, then array, then group, convenience

    -   [*Store
        > V3*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/874)
        > should be safe. Follow ups add key word.

    -   **Issue is test coverage (80%)**

        -   rmdir() outside of the class aren’t tested yet.

    -   Tests needed a bit of updating to override create_store

        -   (to set a path or check for “metadata/$path”)

    -   alpha testers maybe…

    -   to see what’s currently in 2.11:
        > https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/master/docs/release.rst

-   JK: default of write_empty?

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/853*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/853)

    -   JM: just quick and dirty benchmark. @@DB

    -   DB: Add some documentation? Depends on the contents of the array

    -   JK: go beyond docs. Maybe even have a blurb / blog post. include
        > benchmark.

        -   and release notes.

-   also re: 2.11

    -   Dimitri?

        -   Nice cleanups. Maybe bundle PRs? (largely due to
            notifications)

    -   GL: can test the alpha (also to check the napari repo)

    -   see
        > https://github.com/ome/ome-zarr-py/blob/master/.github/workflows/zarr-dev.yml

    -   https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations/actions/workflows/zarr-dev.yml

    -   https://pepy.tech/project/zarr

-   JM: few applications for community manager

-   NB: assuming we meet for the 15th, skip the 29th, and come back on
    the 12th of January!
