# 17th November, 2021

Attending: Greg, Josh, Hailey, Ryan, Davis

-   Josh: brain, logo, sharding, cog/tiledb

    -   logo: RW pink gradient in full screen. WF: all nice

    -   brain: nibabel community will have a call

    -   sharding: work starting

    -   tiledb: group metadata & hierarchy traversal

-   WF: proposal writing process (group effort)

    -   deadline in a couple of weeks.

-   DB: something for the docs

    -   wanted to test python 3.9 - no idea

    -   tox was breaking

    -   JM: tox-conda? Maybe.

    -   WF: little cheatsheets / pamphlet size per project. Could use
        > something like that for AGU (presenting nczarr)

        -   one-pager? qrcode / gitter

    -   WF: DOI? No. Only zenodo:
        > [*https://zenodo.org/record/5541020#.YZVVzb3MIeY*](https://zenodo.org/record/5541020#.YZVVzb3MIeY)

-   JM: oh yeah, big endian crap

    -   see
        > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/869*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/869)

    -   WF: used qemu directly.

    -   GL: something similar with cibuildwheel for arch64 (GHA)

-   GL: opened PR for V3 classes

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/874*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/874)

    -   shouldn’t break anything V2

    -   shouldn’t release without the high-level methods

    -   2 follow-up PRs with the rest of the sections

    -   JM: perhaps we try to get 2.11 out before merging any of that

-   GL: for John K.

    -   question from the RAPIDS team.

    -   they have C++ code to read SVS for a client

    -   questions about in general

    -   reading on the CPU (similar to openslide; multithreaded)

        -   can read patches e.g. to train DL

    -   there is a cuTIFF package internally (working towards it)

    -   cf. John Lefman

    -   DB: at Janelia IO is an issue. direct GPU access would be great.
        > GL not yet. (That’s all TIFF based)

    -   Maybe a future GPU/image meeting, or just general chat.

-   JM: benchmarking

    -   DB: will be nice to see converted datasets in shards..

    -   JM: ASV or similar running on netcdf? WF: Not regularly. Can be
        > turned on. mostly want to see downward slope of

        -   will generate more benchmarks between HDF5 and NCZarr

-   JK: post-call (due to DST; 20:11 UK)

    -   interest nvidia/zarr support

    -   see:

        > (re: NGFF)

    -   Q1: who’s adopting & how many people?

        -   Josh : companies, C#, etc.

    -   Q2: what is the community missing?

        -   Moving to the V3 spec.
        -   for nvidia, whatever library they adopt reads/writes the V3
            spec
        -   a lot of people in the cloud, so GPU-direct reader would
            need to be cloud-aware

    -   “Versioned arrays”

        -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/76*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/76)

        > etc.

    -   Big V3 advertisement!

    -   Babysitter/sabbatical money…

    -   Q3: Compression? zstd,
        > [*jpeg2k*](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/zarr-jpeg2k),
        > [*apr*](https://biii.eu/adaptive-pixel-representation)

    -   Q4: which C++ library? Z5, xtensor-zarr, netcdf, tensorstore
