# 8th September, 2021

Attendees: Josh, Dennis, Hailey, Eric, Greg, John Kirkham, Davis

-   NetCDF

    -   Hailey: netcdf-java codec framework set up, but haven’t chosen
        > the implementations.

        -   Using a ServiceProvider implementation (answering to ID or
            Name)

        -   Codecs can be added by users (usable, but not built in)

        -   Otherwise, read-only & AWS S3 SDK.

            -   Eric: abstraction level!

            -   Josh: at least in Java,
                > [*FileSystem*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html).

            -   Dennis: priority? Eric: S3 \> GCS \> Azure

            -   API is ok, but authorization is hard. Otherwise could
                > build own.

        -   Reduced capacity moving forward.

    -   Dennis: PR for supporting filters in Zarr (merged to master)

        -   Looking for a S3 client library. Old version of AWS SDK C++
            works. Newer dies. AWS Labs C dies (different reason)
        -   License needed: non-GPL.

-   Josh: point clouds (e.g.
    [*potree*](https://github.com/ghgr/potree/blob/master/docs/file_format.md))

    -   Any connections?

    -   Dennis: similar (big) issue in NetCDF. Whole subsystem in Java.

    -   Hailey: might have pulled it out.

-   Dennis: status of N5?

    -   Josh: (report)

    -   Dennis: could netcdf-java make use of the filters
        > implementation?

    -   Eric: issues with jzarr (doesn’t work with blosc on mac)

    -   Josh: could collaborate on the codec interface. don’t think
        > anyone has proposed anything.

    -   Josh:
        > [*https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw/pull/89*](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw/pull/89)
        > for example of using FileSystem

-   Davis: [*empty
    chunks*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/738)

    -   Dennis: expensive?

-   Davis: any chance of seeing sharded format

    -   Josh: report on webknossos. Need a C API.

    -   Will that bubble up into the Zarr API?

    -   Davis: violates current write in parallel simplicity

    -   Eric: append only sharding. or read-only? Then efficient access
        > suffices.

    -   Davis: you can also use space-filling curves (morton, etc.)

        -   Optimization of range requests

    -   Eric: superchunk & chard are interchangeable

    -   Davis: don’t like the “shard” terminology.

    -   Dennis: variable size chunking? Eric: adaptive meshes could use
        > it, yes. (but lots of complexity)

        -   Eric: possible currently with dask lazy arrays
        -   Dennis: perhaps meant change chunk size and have it overtime
            migrate.
        -   Synchronization issue
