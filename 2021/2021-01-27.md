        > (Commercial arm of OME) if for a Java implementation of Zarr
        > V3?

-   Jackson: spec/impl discussion (Tiffs as Zarr)

    -   I got a question for you all as to how to handle a spec
        > implementation. I am not sure if it's a tifffile aszarr, dask
        > from_zarr issue, or a general "the spec is still undetermined
        > issue"

    -   Work on
        > [*aicsimageio*](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio/)
        > in free time

    -   Preparing to support pyramids

    -   [*https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio/issues/140*](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio/issues/140)

    -   Josh: only “spec” I know of is

    -   Josh: see also:
        > [*https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/4118*](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/4118)

-   Martin:

    -   NB: Jackson: **thanks for fsspec**

    -   Maybe interest in
        > [*intake_informaticslab*](https://github.com/informatics-lab/intake_informaticslab)
        > (some logic for parsing paths)

        -   Zarr for accessing chunks that are each HDF5.
        -   Can additionally save zarr locally as cache
        -   Something to backport? Cache as a wrapper

    -   For fsspec-reference-maker, need various new codecs: szip, jpeg…

        -   needed in numcodecs
        -   Josh:
            [*https://git.embl.de/balazs/B3D*](https://git.embl.de/balazs/B3D)
        -   Martin: also true for GRIB files. DICOM.
        -   Josh: need for “functions”. Martin: see
            [*templating*](https://github.com/intake/fsspec-reference-maker/issues/7)
            method.
        -   Also JSON isn’t overly efficient. Zarr itself. Even if
            tuple-like….

-   Matthias:

    -   Ramping up on napari

    -   Partial read from andrew has been merged

    -   I’m working on reenabling flake /mypy in CI (Josh: merged)

        -   May need to go back to 120 line length

    -   Rebasing my basestore PR.

    -   Also looking at numcodecs, release, and then migrate to blosc
        > wheels

        -   Jackson: can look. Dropping overhead. (Czaki)
        -   Wheels are the future? so ok. ci-buildwheel marks per
            platform. (Sub-optimal)

-   Misc

    -   General worries on Python 3.x release schedule….

    -   Matthias: Jupyter folks are thinking of writing rust and
        > compiling to Python, JS

        -   Jackson: dask in rust. Martin: that’s difficult

        -   [*https://github.com/aschampion/rust-n5*](https://github.com/aschampion/rust-n5)
            (and [*rust-pyn5*](https://github.com/pattonw/rust-pyn5))

        -   John: limited number of compressors.

        -   Matthias:
            [*https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3*](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)
            very simple.
