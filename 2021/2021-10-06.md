# 6th October, 2021

Attending: Josh, Ryan W,. Greg Lee, John K., Ward F., Hailey J.

-   Planning Poker, Life, Etc.

-   Ward: software sustainability for NSF solicitation (3yr)

    -   Pitching: adding parallelism to C (*a la* MPI) and adoption of
        > V3 (plus educational materials, etc.)

    -   Looking for collaborators. (Allen Cell Science, Janelia, …)

-   Josh: moving forward on a couple of fronts

    -   Discussion with Norman around prototype for sharding

    -   Discussion with xarray contractors around formalizing
        > conventions

        -   multiscale, \_ARRAY_DIMENSION, tables (recent hackathon)

    -   Ward: have xarray compatibility on the main branch to be
        > released soonish (maybe in 4.8.1).

        -   Ryan Abernathey has recently joined the steering committee.
        -   Good to be part of those discussions
        -   Introducing new functionality -- bit grooming (lossy
            compression) -- improving compression rates by chopping of
            bits smartly
        -   cf. having the burden of enforcing e.g. cfconventions at the
            right location
        -   What is a convention & what is a technical obligation for
            people working with/on zarr.

    -   Josh: best idea so far is new repo that publishes to github
        > pages

        -   Ward: publishing best practices/guidance

            -   “Not rigidly enforced by software”

        -   John: balance between extension & convention

        -   Ward: extensions? [*see:
            /core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions.html*](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions.html)

        -   cfconventions are lexikon of metadata & a process for using
            them

        -   e.g. precise terms to use for labelling data.

        -   Josh: in comparison, extensions can change the behavior of
            code (\`timestamp\`s returned rather than \`str\`s)

        -   Ward: map into/out of HDF5 for storing netcdf4 such that the
            HDF5 may not do you any good (without the netcdf library).
            This feels somewhat similar.

-   Greg:

    -   Away until the 12th

    -   Feedback on PRs by then would be useful

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pulls/grlee77*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pulls/grlee77)

    -   BaseStore first if you can.

-   Hailey

    -   PR within the next week for codecs in netcdf library.

    -   Ward: responsibility for netcdf-java in THREDDS…

-   ZSC: sign the document!

-   Outreachy update

    -   accepted, 4 projects proposed

    -   no contributors have showed up yet

    -   might write up some of the even simpler things (survey)
