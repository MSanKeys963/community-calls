# 2022-11-30

**Attending:** Josh Moore (JM; aikido/books/coffee), John Kirkham (JK; hiking, reading), Sanket Verma (SV; video games & pixel art), Dennis Heimbigner (DH; drawing/guitar), Eric Perlman (EP; travel/bikes/trains), Martin Durant (MD; who has the time), Norman Rzepka (NR; kids & cooking), Ward Fisher (WF; video games/3d printers/wood & leather working), Isaac Virshup (IV; cooking < eating, bouldering), Davis Bennett (DB; birds & computer games), Brianna Pagán (BP; ultra running & my doggo)
**and welcoming**: Dieu My Nguyen (DMN; NASA, replacing Brianna; CS in computational bio; travel, house plants, hiking)

## TL;DR:

We have a new community member who joined today: Dieu My Nguyen from NASA. Thanks for attending the community meeting Dieu! 🙌🏻

Two Outreachy interns have been selected to work with Zarr for the next 3 months. BP asked if anyone is working on partial Zarr stores. After that, DB raised some opinions on the zarr-python slicing API, and lastly DH had some questions related to the V2 spec.

**Updates:**

- Outreachy Interns to work on Tutorials (AWA Brandon) and Testing Zip Stores (Weddy)! 🎉
- ZEP1 [Project board](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/projects/2/views/2) and PRs: [https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/projects/2/views/2](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/projects/2/views/2)
- PyData Global 2022:
    - Talk: [https://global2022.pydata.org/cfp/talk/DQSXAX/](https://global2022.pydata.org/cfp/talk/DQSXAX/)
    - Sprint: [https://pydata.org/global2022/sprints/#zarr](https://pydata.org/global2022/sprints/#zarr)

**Meeting Minutes:**

- BP: Question around if anyone is doing work with partial zarr stores or live archives in zarrs.
  - Growing in at least one dimension
  - Good chunking strategies but not 
  - Pushing updates
  - MD: Zarr has been _sort of_ archivey. Good to talk about "append, append, append". Updating data is less common. See Ryan's strategy.
  - BP: hackathon during AGU. Hub in LA if anyone wants to join.
  - DB: if you have a well-defined shape then it should be ok. Chunks are never partial on disk. (At least that's not variable)
    - Changing origin would be expensive. (Rename everything)
  - JK: if you are only using part of a chunk, it will fill with fill_value. Resizing could lead to zeroes. (MD: yes, recent shock)
  - IV: [ZEP3](https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0003.html)? BP: Yes. Should be contributing. Have done some work internally.
- DB: zarr-python slicing API: aged well? alternatives?
  - critique points:
    - process of adding static types to PRs led to looking at the slicing API
    - [https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/main/zarr/indexing.py](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/main/zarr/indexing.py)
    - numpy has expressive slicing (integer, tuple, slice object, tuple of slice object, tuple of arrays)
    - in Zarr, ever type in the polymorphism is a class. no interface in common
    - spit out 2 things: number of chunks and with same arity set of operations to do on them
      - maybe three levels of indexing, but perhaps order of operations depends on the compressor
    - MD: looked at numpy's implementations or is it in C.
    - DB: assumed they were encumbered by organic growth
    - MD: likely, but lots of testing. Also: normalizing to in-memory indexing (set of) then might be just one implementation
    - DB: then imagined a package that solved the problem which could be shared with napari, etc.
    - DH: looked at HDF5? (difficult) DB: maybe h5py since they handle the polymorphism.
    - JM: possibly [https://pypi.org/project/h5py-like/](https://pypi.org/project/h5py-like/) too
    - JK, dask array slicing? np slicing does a bunch of stuff. led to vindex and oindex.
    - IV: views on arrays in Julia is really nice. JK: multidispatch helps (IV: and n-dim in the lang.)
    - JK: there was a performance issue on slicing, now fixed, but likely just a subset.
- DH: questions about v2.
  - feedback for JS about the current nczarr extensions
  - shape of an array isn't fixed? stated anywhere (JM: explained recent issues)
    - JK: [https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/188](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/188)
  - scalars (arrays of rank 0) are ok? 
  - char type (in numpy)? (like a scalar string)
  - IV: strings? DH: fixed length is in, but varlength proposed and close to varlen arrays.
