# 12th January, 2022

## 🎉 *Happy New Year!*


**Attending**: Davis Bennett, Josh Moore, John Kirkham, Greg Lee, Eric
Perlman, Tobias Kölling, Hailey Johnson, Ward Fisher

-   Davis: Move forward with set_write_empty_chunks?

    -   Eric: any metadata to say that it was written this way?

        -   John: not fatal just will be empty value.
        -   Josh:
            https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/489
        -   DVB: *different* problem with shards.

    -   Have a script to test performance

        -   Depends on latency, compressor, etc.
        -   Testing of emptiness isn’t the most performant

    -   **No objections. Moving forward with 2.11.**

    -   Anything for spec?

        -   JK:
            https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/master/docs/spec/v2.rst#chunks
            is good to go.

-   Greg ok with 2.11? Yes. Nothing needs pulling or adding.

    -   Need a release note. (TBD)

    -   Spent some time on V3 PRs.

    -   Sixth passes CI.

    -   Consolidated metadata now works (but we want that to be an
        > extension!)

    -   Unimplemented stores

        -   ABSStore & N5Store
        -   Davis to review N5Store
        -   Do we need a Hierarchy object? (e.g. when you create a group
            you have to give it a path) – main difference (requires
            issues in tests due to create_store needing a path)

-   JK: Davis’ PR for trimming chunks?

    -   DVB: Languishing. Synchronization issue in appending with
        > co-processing

    -   JK: design decision to make appending easy. But we need to
        > design whether or not we will handle it in sharding.

-   JM: Moving forward with community manager position (2 years)

-   TK:

    -   sharding

    -   checksuming (structure looks like IPLD

        -   JSON document with hash for chunks

        -   how could we write out [*content addressable
            chunks*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/82)

        -   MutableMapping that’s write only (remembers content
            identifiers)

        -   DVB: use case?

            -   nice if you want to calculate checksums, even for part
                > of an array. (helps if it’s in a merkle tree)

            -   makes it easier to share the data in multiple pieces.
                > you can have copies everywhere.

            -   interesting optimizations for big datasets: to get
                > difference between two variables, you want them
                > defined on the same grid (even if you don’t care what
                > the grid is)

            -   JK: cloud store that’s write-once, since you only need
                > to write each hash once. (bonus of time exploration
                > feature with history of the chunks)

            -   TK: discovered over the holidays that the
                > content-addressable & the IPFS solutions could be the
                > same.

                -   [*IPLD*](https://ipld.io/) have special type that’s
                    a link via a content-identifier

            -   JAM: “fsspec concern”? TK: reading yes, but for writing
                > it gets more difficult. No key-value concept. May also
                > be useful to express the content-identifiers to a
                > higher-level for optimizations.

            -   JK: explore implementing on top of MutableMapping
                > interface and that’s what Zarr uses. Naive idea, Zarr
                > special key that has metadata but address of each
                > chunk. Gets difficult since the top-special-key needs
                > to be writable. Josh: perhaps that key *is the* Zarr.
                > JK: grab all of them? request small JSON things from
                > the cloud. Takes place of consolidated metadata? (“one
                > big request”) TK: you would also need to write it out
                > as well (only visible afterwards). JK: start running
                > in to ACID. Tertiary concern, but lot of writing might
                > create chunks that you no longer care about that need
                > cleaning. ZHierarchy could be like UTC time (time
                > since last debug) → git for the cloud.

-   netcdf-java

    -   On non-zarr stuff. (Big funded push is done now)

-   netcdf-fortran!

    -   Zarr API is properly working there.

    -   housekeeping, etc.

    -   Josh interesting issue from Julia community on order swapping
        > recently.

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations/issues/42*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations/issues/42)

-   JK:

    -   Nvidia GPU-based Zarr to avoid host-memory transfer

        -   Requires 2 pieces

        -   CuPy part (JK needs to review that
            [*PR*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/934))

        -   Compression (someone working on that now)

            -   DVB: which codecs? most basic ones. blosc is unclear.
                > DVB: super interested! preferably a simple one incl.
                > Java clients, but primarily transfer to GPU is a
                > bottleneck. Happy to test.

            -   [*https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvcomp*](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvcomp)
                > (snappy, etc.)

            -   DVB: unsigned bits. no compression automization. use
                > case is getting output of ML model, making
                > predications on 3D arrays. (writing use case includes
                > multi-resolution pyramids)

            -   TK: climate models - too much data that needs
                > compression (GRIB backed …) Trying to convince them to
                > use Zarr. But **floats**.

            -   JK: happy to get a list of compressors. (on an issue or
                > via email) TK: currently investigating.

-   JAM: data-apis?

    -   JK: not sure we want to be a provider, but as a consumer. being
        > a provider gets us into providing consumption.

    -   Ward: That is a long-standing issue with netCDF as well. re:
        > pressure to start performing computations w/in the netCDF
        > library.

    -   DVB: what happens with array inception? (dask-zarr-dask)

    -   JK: Martin adding entrypoint support into numcodecs, perhaps
        > something similar to say a zarr.array entrypoint
