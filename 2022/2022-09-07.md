# 2022-09-07

**Attending:** Sanket Verma (SV), Josh Moore (JM), Davis Bennett (DB), Dennis Heimbigner (DH), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS), Hailey Johnson (HJ), Brianna Pag√°n (BP), Isaac Virshup (IV)

## TL;DR:

SV announced new ZEP bi-weekly meetings apart from regular bi-weekly community meetings. Now, the Zarr Community will be meetings two times every two weeks. New illustrations by Henning Falk, check them [here](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-illustrations-falk-2022). Google Summer of Code 2022 is finally coming to an end. After the updates, JM discussed having a hierarchy that builds a virtual n-dimensional array. Then, JMS started discussing one of the open issues in the `zarr-specs` repo; check the issue [here](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/141).

**Updates:**

- ZEP meetings will take place bi-weekly on Thursdays @ `21:30 IST/18:00 CEST/17:00 BST/12:00 EDT/9:00 PDT`
    - Instructions: [https://zarr.dev/community-calls/](https://zarr.dev/community-calls/)
    - More focused on the spec than these meetings
- Check out our new illustrations here: [https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-illustrations-falk-2022](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-illustrations-falk-2022)
    - More ideas welcome!
    - Sharding...
- `copy` button for code snippets in Zarr documentation, check here: [https://zarr--1124.org.readthedocs.build/en/1124/](https://zarr--1124.org.readthedocs.build/en/1124/) @ Altay Sansal [#PR1124](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1124) 
- Approaching end of GSOC (12th of Sep)
  - [https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry)
  - Looking to participate in Outreachy [https://outreachy.org/](https://outreachy.org/)
  - New potential users & developers
  
**Open Agenda (add here üëáüèª):**
- JMS: plan for resolving v3 spec?
  - SV: more on this tomorrow but some progress looking at open issues
  - Upcoming work
  - JM: proposal to have ZEP0001 moved to a "provisional ZEP" state (only blockers allowed)
  - JMS: idea is no spec discussion at this meeting? SV: no, but we'll communicate back and forth
  
- SV: updates on Brianna/Hailiang's ZEP? BP: Not yet. SV: also welcome to join tomorrow

- IV: zarrR?
  - [https://github.com/fsspec/kerchunk/issues/212](https://github.com/fsspec/kerchunk/issues/212)
  - Josh: 
  
- JM: idea of having a hierarchy that builds a virtual n-dim array
  - DB: adds brittleness. would say no.
  - IV: kind of like kerchunk but with more indirection
  - JMS: sometimes have use cases.
    - stacks of images that you want to view as an array, or multiple images acquired separately.
    - Do have stack driver in tensorstore (with specificed origins. No stored representation)
  - DB: similar problem when acquired in HDF. wrote own layer.
  - JMS: might should be a layer higher than zarr.
  - DB: for bioimaging, if your app depends on this then you can only open HDF and Zarr and not other stuff.
    - doesn't need to be compiled code. API problem.

- NaN/inf/other special values in user-defined attributes: [https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/141](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/141)
  - zarr-python supports by encoding in non-JSON-compliant way
  - DB: nothing that can be stored as data shouldn't be impossible to store as an attributes
  - DH: was dealing with this recently. found "NaN" (quoted string) in existing datasets, expecting it to be treated as such. added support to nczarr (as well as unquoted versions)
  - JM: will likely need a deprecation/warning/error cycle (royal pain)
  - IV: keep JSON and use them as special values? nice that it is all just JSON.
  - DH: nczarr (netcdf API) got ahead of this because typing is stored for attributes ("double"). possibility for v3?
  - JMS: good point. perhaps decide the model for attributes in v3 (i.e. proposed change to v3 spec)
  - JM: will need an upgrade path
  - DB: haven't seen untyped attributes, but just that JSON is missing values
  - DH: so extend constants that are definable
  - JM: BSON?
  - IV: there are also things that can't be encoded in zarr
  - DH: one problem with extending JSON is that in C code that there are JSON parsers that would choke
    - JMS: zarr-python has essentially already done that
  - **Enumerating options:**
    1. extend JSON parser (generally :-1:)
    2. support existing JSON-variants (BSON) (generally :-1:)
    3. encode objects in JSON
       a. `{"attribute":...`
       a. `{"@type":...`
    4. add type information somewhere else (like .nczarr)
  - JM: (2) might be a metadata-driver like separate chunk-stores
    - DH: if it's binary, then you need a good spec. and need to show equivalence between binary version and JSON.
    - JMS: you might be writing the non-JSON attribute late in the process, which would cause problems
    - DH: binary could help with speed since string level parsing is expensive
    - DB: always thought of the metadata as the stuff you want to read with editor and you don't want peformance issues
    - DH: have had number of examples of NC-4 files that are enormous (10s of MB of metadata)
      - also abusing grouping for "namespaces" (even if not a good idea)
  - IV: is this Zarr's responsibility? cf. Pydantic which can turn your values into something else. (i.e. external schema)
    - DB: but Zarr is responsible for storing "fill_value"
      - IV: that's .zarray rather than .zattrs
  - DB: would assume that the `.attrs` property takes care of encoding/decoding
  - JMS: would see saying ".zattrs supports JSON + these encodings"
  - IV: do all the languages support this?
    - Javascript?
    - JMS: `Array[UInt8Array]`
  - SV: an extension?
    - JMS: could fail on invalid JSON now and then add encoding/decoding later (since there's already the issue with V2)
  - IV: Arrow requires everything to be an arrow type (everything else is string with encoding)
    - DH: did that in netcdf-4
    - DB: sqlite is the same way
    - DH: include numpy with json type (from string)
      - IV: almost done with PR on awkward arrays (using this). depends on the JSONs
      - JMS: would make sense to standardize that (decide: pure JSON or extended JSON)
  - IV: see [https://github.com/scverse/anndata/pull/569](https://github.com/scverse/anndata/pull/569)
- SV: heading to California next week for NumFOCUS & CZI summit (also NJ & NYC)
