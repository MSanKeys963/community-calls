- 2.13.0a1 releasing soon with updates from [Davis](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1094), [Mads R.B.](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/934) and [Jonathan](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1096)
  - Josh: 2.13 next alphas
  - https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release.html#release-2-13-0
- Phase 1 of GSoC 2022 completed! üéâ Check progress [here](https://alt-shivam.github.io/Codecs-Registry/)
  - JMS: would be good to have specification (json-schema?) for each
  - Goal: have clients interact with the registry to give users info/feedback
- async zarr https://github.com/martindurant/async-zarr
  - anacoda hackweek per quarter (2-day-hack)
  - for discussion https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/community?at=62f3ed24d020d223d36587d5
  - http only and other simplifications
  - JMS: targeting runtimes outside of the browser?
  - AM: cloudflare worker? WebAssembly support. (MD: already in pyodide)
    - lightweight VMs (e.g., for security)
  - https://github.com/zarr-developers/community/issues/14
  - IV: story for downstream library developer to use? rewrite to use await
    - MD: definitely must use await (can't go in and out of the event loop)
    - use case: first chunk of several arrays
    - MD: e.g. what would xarray for example use it
    - MD: somethings already work: bokeh, etc.

Open agenda:
- ...add here ...
- AM: Question about the Zarr Spec v3 (ZEP1)
  - Like that it's very bare bones
  - Though experiment: Could a video codec be implemented?
    - Compress across time; key frames
    - JMS: 3d xyt chunks would work (individually)
    - MD: variable length chunks. Critical to video compression (per key frame)
    - MD: if each chunk has all the time points
    - MD: but also in favor of variable length chunks
    - JMS: what's the connection?
    - MD: video compressions support large range of chunk size based on how quickly the video is changing
    - JMS: just make time chunking big enough and internal is a detail
    - JS: remove chunking across the time dimension
      - currently inefficient, but with partial reads it could work
      - let video codec request chunks of data from the store
    - MD: internal to codec or explicit at the zarr level
    - JM: difference in the fundamental model? (atomicity)
    - MD: 1-dimensional delta codec, make it across an arbitrary dimension?
    - AM: if Zarr intends to be the metadata format, this is a stress test.
    - JMS: with fixed key rate, 
    - JM: see also https://mpeg-g.org/
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/5ejUnWh.png)
- HZ: extension proposal
  - implementation for multidimensional data analysis
  - introducing auxillary datasetse in reduced datasets (non-scalar, accumulation value)
  - helps to speed up computation. Ryan A. suggested a spec extension
  - MH: averaging over time or spatial extensions
  - JM: cf. https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/50 
  - IV: perhaps like transforms https://github.com/ome/ngff/issues/101
  - JS: difference of whether or not it leads to an additional array
- IV: Non-uniform chunks ‚Äì timing?
  - conversation with JK at SciPy
  - broad desire to have them exist. any objections?
  - have several masters students to put on this
  - JM: ZIC?
  - IV: can discuss if in spec or as an extension
  - JS: would still have a formal spec even if an extension (eases adoptions, clear interface)
  - IV: ZEP0001 timeline?
  - SV: on me. working with Alistair to apply the modifications. ASAP.
- JMS: meta-issue for scheduling time to work on the V3 spec
  - way to speed up progress? additional meetings?
  - SV: ZIC meeting?
  - JM: editorial meeting? Add JMS?
  - JS: happy to be in discussions with AM but also open issues that need discussion
