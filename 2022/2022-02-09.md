# 9th February, 2022

**Attending**: Jonathan Striebel, Davis Bennett, Eric Perlman, Josh
Moore (JAM), Sanket Verma, Jeremy Maitin-Shepard, Hailey Johnson, Erik
Welch (Anaconda → NVIDIA), John Kirkham, Dennis Heimbigner, Dave
Mellert, Greggory Lee, Matt McCormick

-   Davis: gdoc → hackmd? Sure!

    -   Sanket: suggestions

-   Sanket:

    -   updated webpage, blog update

    -   [*https://zarr.dev/blog/welcoming-community-manager/*](https://zarr.dev/blog/welcoming-community-manager/)

-   Intros & various links here

    -   Erik: [*Mr. Sparse*](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html)

    -   ….

-   Jeremy:

    -   C(++) implementations: quick report to Dennis from
        > [*https://imagesc.zulipchat.com*](https://imagesc.zulipchat.com)

    -   v3 support for non-zero origin
        > ([*issue*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/122))

        -   Dennis: would attribute specifying the origin be enough?
            have benefited from cfconventions which standardize the
            meaning of attributes (in atmospheric/related domains)
        -   JMS: benefit of allowing indexing to be affected.
        -   DH: second system syndrome problem
            ([*link*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect))
        -   DB: see the utility (working with cutouts) but the workflow
            puts us outside what’s in the core spec. zarr array
            shouldn’t have metadata that references another array.
            perhaps a nice formalization of transforms, since it defines
            a coordinate space.
        -   JMS: julia has offset arrays (numpy is always 0-origin’ed)
        -   DB: meaning of 0-origin is that there’s a coordinate space
        -   EP: like the functionality, but it can be at a different
            level.
        -   DH: specify the array it came from as well as the origin?
        -   zaJMS: have translate to origin
        -   DB: in xarray use piece of data to coordinate-aware
            indexing, two methods of getting into an array.
        -   JAM: prioritizing the many recent spec proposals
        -   DB: suggest talking to other consumers and see what they
            want.

-   Addition of sharding in spec v3
    ([*issue*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/127)/py
    →
    [*issue*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/127)/spec)

    -   Status: 2 prototype PRs (plus a [*minimal
        > implementation*](https://github.com/alimanfoo/zarrita/pull/40)
        > in zarrita)

    -   Moving forward with v3 would be fine.

    -   Try a PR as a on the v3 spec for a translation layer (i.e.
        > generically)

        -   sharding, checksumming, IPFS, etc.

    -   JMS: don’t see the relationship between sharding & checksumming

        -   JAM: due to content-addressable storage
        -   DH: just as a compressor/filter that attaches the checksum
        -   JS: partial read would need to be handled somewhere that’s
            not in the compression
        -   JAM: kerchunk API of \`key → (uri, offset, length)\`
        -   JMS: for the write path it is more complicated

    -   DH: makes me nervous when we worry about limitations of the
        > underlying store w.r.t to the specification. spec should be
        > storage-agnostic.

        -   DH: v2 is agnostic of relative location of chunk/metadata
            are laid out on disc. Don’t need to be “next” to one
            another. This is introducing pieces **and** that they are
            together.
        -   Be sure you want to get rid of the independence property
        -   JK: more simple way of describing it. (An ordering).
        -   DH: the proposal needs to specify the relationships between
            chunks that are supported.
        -   DB: agreed complicated but 100% worth it for some domains.

    -   re-writing methods?

        -   disallowed

        -   only if uncompressed?

            -   JS: not yet, but doesn’t currently exist for simplicity

        -   rewrite index

-   v3 (Greg)

    -   In terms of the dtypes supported, I have not worked on those
        > protocol extensions related to that. Is that something I
        > should spend time on? The other thing I could do is make a WIP
        > PR to Dask and Xarray with minimal changes for how they could
        > support v3 as currently implemented in that branch.

-   ‘[*zarr_implementations*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations)’:
    remote implementations: http/s3/etc

    -   good point

    -   EP to create an issue

    -   JAM:

-   Tabled

    -   xarray:
        > [*dataclasses*](https://github.com/astropenguin/xarray-dataclasses)
        > / [*datatree*](https://github.com/TomNicholas/datatree)
        > ([*issue*](https://github.com/spatial-image/spatial-image-multiscale/issues/8)) -
        > (if Matt McCormick shows up)
