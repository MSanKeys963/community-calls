    -   [*307*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/pull/307#issuecomment-1048307145)
        > flatten: *need an attribute?*

        -   *John: Unsure.* zfpy remembers internally.

    -   [*305*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/pull/305#issuecomment-1048536081)
        > ndarray-like

    -   HJ: NetCDF meeting on codecs soon. Good to know prioritization

        -   blosc of course

    -   JM: Twitter poll? “What compressor do you frequently use in
        > Zarr?”

    -   EP: discussed with d-v-b that lossy compressors would be nice.

        -   jpeg chunk storage
        -   JK: tried zfpy? No. from seung lab. (Meteorological data)

    -   JMS: imagecodecs from Gohlke.  
        > more explicit std. in v3 (need json for each parameter)

-   Jeremy (in order of importance)

    -   1\. [*consistency in referring to coordinates / dimension
        > order*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/129)

        -   a\. Unambiguously referring to dimensions / coordinates
            (top)

            -   Ward: in NC order of dimensions is under the hood,
                > indexing into set of arrays independently of the
                > underlying order. file written by netcdf-fortran
                > should be indistinguishable from by netcdf-c (due to
                > work in the library to be
                > machine/language-independent)

            -   JMS: tension cf. Julia’s desire of order

            -   WF: similar issue with endianness? JMS: big endian
                > likely dead WF: sadly no. see netcdf repo for redhat

        -   b\. Support for different storage orders:
            https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/129

        -   c\. Support for non-zero origin

    -   2\. appetite for zarr multiscale spec?

        -   Josh:
            xarray/[*datatree*](https://github.com/TomNicholas/datatree)
            status
        -   Move metadata from .zattrs to .zarray?
        -   JMS: primarily getting it outside of OME, in discrete state

    -   3\. Data type syntax

    -   4\. URL syntax

-   notes in [*https://hackmd.io*](https://hackmd.io)?

    -   Yes: Josh, Greg, Ward, …

    -   No:

    -   John: not all in one document

    -   “Motion carries”

-   Dennis: could use help on how to work struct into extension

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/49#issuecomment-1047270856*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/49#issuecomment-1047270856)

    -   JMS: one of the big changes in V3 is no support for structs
        > (numpy array)

    -   GL: several datatypes are no in v3. currently missing a document
        > describing those types. e.g.
        > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/898*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/898)

    -   JMS: will numpy be supported in V3?

        -   GL: was easy to implement but they aren’t written up as
            specs yet
        -   Untested are: unicode and bytestring (only indirectly in
            xarray)

    -   JMS: numpy doesn’t support variable length strings

    -   JMS: numpy struct datatypes lead to interleaved in memory. not
        > great for compression. perhaps better to transpose them. would
        > be nice to not be tied to the numpy model.

    -   JK: need something in the spec, which is why it was left out of
        > the spec so far.

    -   GL: just a few types currently in v3. complex would be easy to
        > support. can choose what goes in or not. (or warn or error …)

    -   DH: trying to figure out how to support as much of NC/HDF5 core
        > data model as possible. **Big missing piece are: structs,
        > enumerations, vlenstrings, vlenobjects (sequences)**

    -   JMS: as multiple arrays? DH: question of how to specify in the
        > extension mechanism. (lots of possible implementations)

-   Feedback process (!)

    -   Suggestions welcome.
