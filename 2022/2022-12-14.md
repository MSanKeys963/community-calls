# 2022-12-14

**Attending:** Davis Bennett (DB), Josh Moore (JM), Norman Rzepka (NR), Dieu My Nguyen (DMN), Dennis Heimbigner (DH), Sanket Verma (SV), Hailey Johnson (HJ), John Kirkham (JK)

## TL;DR:

[Numcodecs 0.11](https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/) has been released with the support of Python 3.11. In addition, weâ€™re planning to migrate the Zarr documentation to PyData Sphinx Theme; please look at the [PR #1242](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1242). After sharing these updates, NR started a discussion on ensure_bytes by referring to [PR #1285](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1285). Then DB had a question if anyone tried GPU direct storage, to which JK referred to a blog post which can be seen [here](https://xarray.dev/blog/xarray-kvikio). And we closed the year 2022 by asking everyone what they have been working on recently and their plans for the New Year!

**Updates:**
