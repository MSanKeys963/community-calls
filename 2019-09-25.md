-   Josh: (idea) NetCDF as translation layer between BDV-HDF5 and BDV-N5

    -   Ward: ok, but limitations when writing HDF5 via NetCDF (e.g.
        > nested groups)

    -   Ward: generally, excited about separating common model from
        > storage

    -   Josh: similar to our *meta*data model process at the moment.

    -   Supporting all written files â€¦

    -   Pure Java HDF5 library?

    -   nccopy from HDF5 to zarr/n5!
