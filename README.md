## About Community Calls

Zarr community meetings take place every two weeks where maintainers, contributors and the overall general community get together generally for an hour to discuss ongoing issues, features, bugs, processes or anything important for the development and progress of Zarr. The agenda for the meeting is open and anyone can add items to it. The standing agenda for the community meeting is mentioned above.

We’re always looking to discuss new ideas, implementations, research or anything of interest to Zarr. If you think you have something to share with the Zarr community please join us via this [link](https://zoom.us/j/300670033?pwd=OFhjV0FHQmhHK2FYbGFRVnBPMVNJdz09). New contributors looking for tips and guidance are most welcome to join us. We’d be more than happy to reserve a slot for them at the end of the meeting.
