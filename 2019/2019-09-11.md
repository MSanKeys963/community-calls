# 11th September, 2019

At the water cooler: Josh, Ward, Martin

-   Ward: meeting on Thurs. where Dennis will brief UniData folk. Will
    have technical details for next time. Have some functionality, going
    over roadmap. Josh: good choice for focus of next time? Dennis
    likely to join. Program manager was asked to brief ESIP (federation
    of earth science information partners) on status of zarr.

-   Martin:

    -   Local caching of remote resources: filesystem spec should be
        > able to do by itself (one implementation exists). Ability to
        > have global, semi-atomic write ability. E.g. distributed dask
        > cluster. There should be some global context managed by the
        > scheduler that can manage the whole thing. Roll back
        > transactions. For zarr it should be fine, but might be nice to
        > have an all-or-nothing capability.
