-   Specs

    -   

    -   Handling sparse arrays (what is TileDB do here)

    -   [*https://docs.tiledb.io/en/stable/tutorials/format-description.html?highlight=specification*](https://docs.tiledb.io/en/stable/tutorials/format-description.html?highlight=specification)

    -   RyanA: Need to focus on a spec that is well scoped (not to
        > general) for our needs

    -   JohnK: start with types?

    -   Josh: cF.
        > [*https://github.com/imglib/imglib2/tree/master/src/main/java/net/imglib2/type*](https://github.com/imglib/imglib2/tree/master/src/main/java/net/imglib2/type)
        > has a complex type

    -   JohnK: mix in zarr is problematic, also can’t define default
        > complex

        -   Josh: memory layout probably needs to be written in json,
            could also use for fill values

        -   JohnK: see
            [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/354*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/354)

        -   Josh: json-ld?? { “@id”: …., } 

        -   [*https://stdlib.io/develop/docs/api/@stdlib/complex/float64/*](https://stdlib.io/develop/docs/api/@stdlib/complex/float64/) 

            -   {  "type": "Complex128",  "re": 5.0,  "im": -3.0  } 

        -    [*https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/27*](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/27) 

            -   {  "mathjson": "complex",  "real": 3,  "imag": 4 } 

    -   John: Even worse are ***timestamps***

        -   [***https://json-tricks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#preserve-type-vs-use-primitive***](https://json-tricks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#preserve-type-vs-use-primitive)
        -   Fabian: in geo / netcdf world, use “days since” (e.g.) then
            a float. Ignoring leap seconds. Works despite precision
            issues.

    -   Fabian: good to have whatever implemented in C

        -   Balancing usefulness and complexity across multiple
            languages

    -   Structured arrays:

        -   Josh: Tuple of chunks rather than chunk of tuples ?
        -   John: will ask for one particular use case
        -   cF. coordinate selection
