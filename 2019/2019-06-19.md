<span id="anchor-78"></span>Items

-   Ward: Unidata blog post.

    -   [*https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf-and-native-cloud-storage*](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf-and-native-cloud-storage)

    -   Pretty good resonance

    -   More technical details coming under developer blog

-   Josh: upcoming bioimaging blog post as well

    -   “No new formats”

    -   With technical follow up as well.

-   Ward: question

    -   Meeting with various groups (incl. hdfgroup)

    -   Re: HPC data storage

    -   “How well does zarr perform in a super computer environment?”

    -   Josh: Saalfeld’s spark usage at Janelia

    -   Martin: may not be that much benefit on the *reading* side

    -   Ryan: the question is do you have multiple write heads

-   Benchmarks in general

    -   Ward: generalizable dataset of benchmarks (existing or created)
        > would be good

    -   Dimensions: Chunk size, different filesystems (cloud, parallel,
        > hadoop, local)

-   Ryan: peripheral feature - **sparse arrays**

    -   [*https://github.com/daletovar/zsparse*](https://github.com/daletovar/zsparse)
        > (thin wrapper)

    -   3 1-d array is stored like a chunk zarr array

    -   A few fixes sitting locally

    -   Will be useful for single-cell work

    -   Spec changes? No. Application level thing that interacts with
        > underlying arrays.

    -   E.g. wasteful to materialize all the nulls/zeros

    -   Using numpy methods. One of them is the three 1-d arrays.
        > Transforming indices from higher-dimensional space. You can
        > pretend it’s dense.

    -   [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row\_(CSR,\_CRS_or_Yale_format)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_(CSR,_CRS_or_Yale_format))

    -   Got to this via an attempt to add a database backend. Want a
        > virtual layer on top of zarr.

    -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/438*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/438)

-   NetZDF anything to test yet?

    -   Ward: not yet. Will publicize that widely.

    -   May be made such that it can be extracted.

    -   Asked by community and leadership to be more vocal

        -   Heard from Director. “Please put up a blog post”

    -   Lots of interest

    -   Contact? See generic link in blog post. (netcdf-support or ward
        > directly. Or GH page. Upcoming zarr support issue from Ward.)

-   SciPy (John)

    -   Ward: Unidata (another Ryan May) will be there from Pangeo. One
        > of the big Zarr boosters.

    -   Logo to be spread:

        > style="width:1.4953in;height:0.7819in" />

    -   Start using; likely be another iteration though (post scipy)
