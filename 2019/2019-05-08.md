# 8th May, 2019

Time: 20:00 BST (15:00 EDT).

Joining instructions see above.

Intend to attend: Alistair, Josh, Fabian, Ryan W

**Attending**: JohnK, RyanW, Alistair, Fabian, Ward, JoshM, MartinD

<span id="anchor-89"></span>Standing items

-   **Introductions**: new joinees should feel welcome to introduce
    themselves and their interest in zarr/n5.

<span id="anchor-90"></span>TileDB - 20:03 UK

-   Compare their spec structure, e.g., ragged versus non-ragged have
    been split
-   Perhaps similar to the relationship with HDF5. We’re interested in
    providing neat things, e.g. a potential backend.
-   Chatting or even meeting up at some venue.
-   Martin: extracting parts of chunks and updating.
-   Performance / Indexing extension specs? (cF. consolidated metadata).
    Also multiple methods of mapping chunks to cloud objects.

<span id="anchor-91"></span>Spec development - 20:17 UK

-   Core protocol v3.0 development process -- have created a
    *development branch* called core-protocol-v3.0-dev, suggest we make
    PRs against that branch with specific sections

<!-- -->

-   Core protocol v3.0 - conceptual model :
    [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/17*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/17)
    -- has been merged into core-protocol-v3.0-dev branch but comments
    and discussion very welcome, can be revisited

-   Core protocol v3.0 - data types :
    [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/18*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/18)
    -- comments and discussion welcome, particularly regarding division
    between core and extensions

    -   Data types as extension point. (Nice)

-   Core protocol v3.0 - chunk grids :
    [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/22*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/22)
    -- comments and discussion welcome, particularly regarding division
    between core and extensions

    -   Grid as an extension point

    -   E.g. rectilinear grid (i.e. log paper)

    -   Or extension in the negative direction

    -   Fabian: how do extensions interact? A: Probably can’t mix
        > multiple grids (or multiple data types).

-   Extensions:

    -   JohnK: how to manage them? Packaging them for distribution? A:
        > imagined with e.g. zarr-py it might choose to implement the
        > core spec and some set of extensions. Josh: specifying in the
        > specs a way to degrade (when possible)? A: “must understand”
        > extensions as a field.

    -   But also \`pip install\`-ing. A: Would hope that most are just
        > in zarr-py (given numpy) Fabian: from Julia perspective, it
        > would be good to be able to document what is included and what
        > is not. (Goal of course is to implement everything)

    -   Josh: also layering specs on top of each other. (Implementors
        > should naturally start with the lowest level spec) cF. [*image
        > format
        > drawing*](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Vz6F-DZ-KfkFtJrl0cbT7eiRRc3NYT6EtoCwuOVg_kc/edit?pli=1)
        > A: assuming NC spec is included as a protocol spec. (Currently
        > working with the v2 spec?) Doing prep work for the C library.
        > Would be good if v3 was available when code starts getting
        > written. Try to minimize new API calls when adding new
        > formats. Instead use “file flags”. nc_open goes to a dispatch
        > table. Easier for programmers. Would like for this to be true
        > with zarr. (modulo mechanism for passing credentials for
        > accessing the cloud)

-   Keeping entire core fully implementable. (Satisfying)

    -   Listing extensions, storage backends, codecs (complexity,
        > library-support)

    -   Fabian: are there core codecs? W: unidata dealing with this for
        > netcdf. For extended data model+storage (HDF5 based, using
        > libhdf5) have user-defined compressors via their codec
        > support. Finding (opinion) that it’s great to give users that
        > ability, but the less common, the less portal. (Caused issues
        > with e.g. the threadless server) Need a way to *query* the
        > required codec. (Part of the spec)

    -   Josh: agreed, the balance between having data that will last and
        > encouraging advancement in compression space (without creating
        > N new formats)

    -   A: communication status, etc. (But blosc kicked all of this off
        > …)

    -   Perhaps meeting up at
        > [*https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019*](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019)
        > ?

-   Core protocol v3.0 - memory layouts :
    [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/24*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/24)
    -- as above, comments and discussion welcome. (warning: 1 hour
    warning)

    -   The layout *within* a chunk. E.g. dictionary-based encoding.
